### Denver #AlumniAnonymous Structure

2 Hours is spent with the Career Services team on just about anything.  

1 Hour is spent with an instructor, doing interview prep.

#### StandUPdates 

We begin each meeting with scrum style individual reporting, followed by a short standup similar to the program, where we go over 'helps', 'interestings', and 'events'. This is a time to celebrate wins, share tips, and get help. 

##### Check Box 

When we collect everyone's updates, we ask what they want to accomplish before they leave, and that's their check box.

### Activities 

##### Vocab

Alumni and staff go through flash cards or test their knowledge from a previous vocab session. This is a great resource for career services managers to utilize and come back to.  

Flash Cards: http://slides.com/mattsprague/buzzwords#/

##### STAR Method 

Alumni clearly describe a situation while ultilizing the STAR method. The STAR method is a structured manner of responding to a behavioral-based interview question by discussing the specific Situation, Task, Action, and Result of the situation you are describing.

##### Rejectume 

Alumni open their resumes and other job search materials to constructive criticism from peers. 

##### Whiteboarding 

Alumni practice technical interviewing in a whiteboard challenge scenario 

##### Q&A Game

Students take turns passing a ball or marker (whatever is available). When you pass the object, you ask a question. The person who recieves the ball, fields the question, and then asks another question before passing the ball to someone new. 

##### Developer Jeoprady

Just like in class but with more career service oriented topics.

##### Membership Challenge 

Thanks to some enginuity from the Seattle campus team, we've issued a challenge to all alumni to stay on campus as much as possible. 

##### Paired Interview Prep

In groups larger than 2, paired interview prep should be used to maximize ratio.

Tell students they will be pairing up as interviewer and interviewee. Try to pair people who know each other least.  

Choose a subject area, a time limit, and give the link to the interviewer. The interviewer should act as though they are being asked to decide whether or not they want this person as a teammate.

Tell the interviewer they will be tasked with giving feedback to the interviewee - rate them on their communication style and clarity, their problem solving readiness, and their implementation. Ask them follow-up questions as noted in the question list. At the end, rate them from 1-4, 1 being strong no hire, and 4 being strong hire. Ask them to note 2 positive traits, and 2 negative traits.
