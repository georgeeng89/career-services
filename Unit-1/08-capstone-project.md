## Capstone Projects

During the course you will complete an individual capstone project that will serve as the key evidence for employers about what you're capable of building.

A few tips we've heard in the past from project reviewers:
Make sure the final of your project includes evidence of results (Pivotal Tracker stories, mockups, Trello/Asana Boards, and/or an organized public Github repo complete with a 'Readme.md').

Something about your project should be very challenging (Interesting Problem)
Your project should have plausible business value
Make your project well styled and aesthetically pleasing. 

These blogs have examples of awesome projects built in other programs:

### Project Requirements:

You must successfully complete a capstone project that adheres to the following guidelines. Your project must:
* Be sufficiently unique in the cohort
* Have client-side functionality
  * Client-side code may use jQuery, React, Angular, raw JS etc...
  * Client-side code may be part of Express/Rails, or a separate repo
* Have server-side functionality
  * Server-side code may be in Node/Express, Rails, PHP, Python, Go etc..
  * Server-side code must include some kind of persistence - PostgreSQL, Mongo, Redis etc...
* Look decent - either using custom CSS or modified Bootstrap
* If using a framework like Bootstrap, you must modify it to have unique colors/elements etc...
* Be deployed and ready to demo by the provided deadline
* Have some sort of API integration
* Email, maps, stocks, text messages, physical devices etc...

See http://www.programmableweb.com/apis/directory for ideas

Incorporate a technology we didn't cover in-depth in class, i.e. reactjs, socket.io

The ideal project has interesting functionality visible to non-logged-in users (easier for employers to see).
The more creative the better! Anything from card/board games to highly-specific financial apps or apps you wished you had in previous jobs or other situations are all good candidates.

NOTE: in rare cases apps that don't have all of these components may be approved by instructors. If you believe your app is sufficiently complex and awesome, please submit your ideas.

###### Process
* Submit 3 ideas for projects
* Instructors will evaluate and choose the one that seems the most promising (or ask you to go back to the drawing board)
* Once an idea has been approved, you must create a plan such as:
  rough wireframes
  rough stories
  links to documentation proving you can get what you need from APIs etc...
* Start building!
* There will be 1 mid-point checkin with an instructor, with one chance for feedback. Other than that you are largely on your own ('cuz, you know, it's a capstone project)

NOTE: if you already have code on a personal project and want to continue, please submit that along with other ideas, so instructors can evaluate.

###### Assessment
You will have 2 full weeks of time dedicated just to building this application (plus additional time leading up to the 2 weeks). Applications will be judged on being:
100% your own. Copy / cheat and you will automatically fail.
complete (according to the requirements above)

* fully-functional
* sufficiently modern-looking
* sufficiently complex
* Rationale

This capstone project will demonstrate your ability to build fullstack applications from start to finish in a fixed amount of time. You will demo this application at hiring day, and feature it prominently on your resume.
