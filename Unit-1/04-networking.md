### Meetups

You should try to take advantage of as many networking opportunities as possible. When you're making your name in the industry, it's important to have connections that you can call on at a later date. Place special priority on hackathons, conferences, and startup weeks, over regularly occuring user groups and meetups. Come prepared to network, it doesn't hurt to have a copy of your resume or business cards handy.
