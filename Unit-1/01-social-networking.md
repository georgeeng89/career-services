# Social Profiles

Social profiles are social proof. Companies want to hire people who are engaged with the community and express their interests, activities, and ideas on the social web.

There are two rules to consider when setting up (or refactoring) your social profiles.

1. Consistency is important. Figure out a username and use it across ever platform. Additionally, make sure all of your information (name, website, job title, etc.) are consistent on every platform.
2. Activity. This is especially important with Twitter and Github, but generally speaking, you don't want any of these profiles to look like a ghost town.

## LinkedIn


Here are some basic tips for LinkedIn accounts.

*  Change current job position to Full-Stack Developer student at Galvanize
*  Clean clear smiling profile picture
*  All of your contact information filled out and cross-link all other profiles such as Stack overflow, GitHub, personal website, etc.
*  Remove any job positions held under six months that aren’t relevant
*  Make sure all job positions have a clear title, 1 to 4 sentences describing your positions and things you accomplished
*  Remove all skills that aren’t pertinent to web development such as Microsoft Word or the like
*  Add 10 to 15 skills related to computer programming such as JavaScript, Angular, HTML5, etc.
*  Ask your friends to endorse your skills, however do not ask them to endorse all of them because it will look strange if your profile has 15 endorsements from the same person get them to stagger them - one in three is a good ratio
*  Join 10 computer programming groups
*  Send out 5 to 25 requests connect per day to relevant people such as CTO’s, senior developers, or thought leaders in the computer programming world. Don’t bother sending it out to people that are not relevant connections

## GitHub
