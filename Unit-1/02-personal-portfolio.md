# Personal Portfolio

In this day and age, it's necessary for us, as web developers to have a digital portfolio when starting out. 

It's important to think about consistency in your personal brand when building your portfolio.

A great personal portfolio will make you stand out and prove your skills. An important thing to keep in mind is that the portfolio site itself becomes a piece in the portfolio itself, and should reflect the same high quality as your projects.  

Here are a couple features that make up a great portfolio site.

## Projects
Each project should have a small blurb about the tech stack used, the challenge, and why it's interesting. There should be a link to the deployed application and the github repo. It's also a good idea to have a screenshot of the project so people can get a sense of your app without looking through all of the links. You're looking for 'click-bait' to get them off of the portfolio and into your apps exploring and interacting. 

## About
Who are you? (Really think about it) what are all the parts that make you, you. You don't want to come off as a 'cookie cutter' full stack developer, or even worse, just a 'bootcamp graduate'. It's important to talk about what you were doing with your career prior to galvanize, what motivates you, and where you're looking to go. 

## Contact info

In addition to showing your email (in plan text), your site should link to a few of your social profiles (those social profiles should also backlink to your portfolio for SEO purposes)
