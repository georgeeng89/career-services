# Cover Letters

In this lesson, you will learn what makes an effective cover letter for a given position by utilizing the job description to understand which areas to focus on.

Cover letters are an important component of a strong application but can often times be the most challenging to write. Crafting cover letters that are unique to each company/position is an important step for students to take to help differentiate them from other candidates. Cover letters should not be the paragraph form of your resume, you want to bring new information to the table while focusing on the company/position. 

# Objective

* Write cover letters to gets jobs. True mastery will result in a job.
* Use Polya's approach, starting at the job description, to craft sample cover letters.

# Before You Start

Research the Position
(What are the key responsibilities, What skills are needed?)


Research the Organization
(What is the Culture, History, Strategic Goals?)


Identify your most relevant skills and competencies
(Then create “stories” from your experience)


Pull up the job description and use it as a guide

# Formatting Basics

Font (10-12pt standard font)
(Times New Roman, Garamond, Veranda, Helvetica, Arial)


Spacing (Margins should be consistent .5”)
(Center the font on the page, left align text)

Heading
(Use the same header as your resume to “brand” your doc)

# Important Notes:

* Whenever possible, address the letter to a person (spelled correctly)
* Always write something, even if it’s optional (it doesn’t have to be formal)
* Always do your research before writing / applying 
* Cover Letters are not paragraph versions of your resume
* Don’t just talk about yourself, focus more on the company
* Templates get tossed out
* The job description is your #1 guide for what to address 
* Spelling, Grammar, and Formatting are still important
* Bullets points are now widely accepted
* Use the same naming convention for the file as your resume (.pdf only)
* Short and Sweet - stick to relevant information only
* Your first sentence / paragraph is the most crucial 

# The Formula

## First Paragraph

* Lead with something catchy

* Name the specific Position(s) + Office You’re applying to

* Indicate how you learned about position (make it noteworthy)

* State why you’re interested in the position/employer (personalize)

## Second Paragraph

* Indicate WHY you are a good fit for the position (what skills do you possess that will benefit them)

* Explain how your academic experiences provide you with relevant skills

* Describe experiences that illustrate your skills (jobs, projects, etc.)

* Try to tie it all into what they do / look for 

## Last Paragraph

* Reiterate your interest in the organization and position (in new words)

* Indicate that you are available to discuss your qualifications

* Tell them how to reach you

* Close by stating that you hope to hear from them / are available to answer any other questions
