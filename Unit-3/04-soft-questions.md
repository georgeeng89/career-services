- [How to Answer 'What's Your Biggest Weakness?'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qydbsSeNFsQ)

## Background

Companies will ask soft questions to determine if you are a culture fit in their company. Here is a short list of example questions, as well as an exhaustive description of the hardest one, "What is you biggest weakness".

## What is your biggest weakness?

When an interviewer asks "what's your biggest weakness" they have probably heard a thousand bullshit answers to it.  So prepare a few answers _beforehand_ that have the following characteristics:

1. Talk about a _real_ weaknesses that you _actually have_.  This needs to be an actual problem like "I struggle with worklife balance" or "I can get caught up with new shiny languages and frameworks sometimes".
  - If you say "I'm too detail oriented" or "I work too hard" just walk out now.
1. Give specific examples of how the weakness hurts you.
1. Provide _specific evidence_ of improvement or attempts at improvement.
1. Talk about optimism / enthusiasm for fixing it

That last part is the hardest for most people.  Here's an example:

> **Employer:** "What's your biggest weakness?"

> **You:** "That's a tough one.  I think I'd have to say that my biggest weakness is that when I'm focused on something, I can let a lot of things slip by the wayside.  For example I was doing some hard code katas the other day, and I was having fun and then forgot to grade homework for my students."

> "This has been a persistent problem for me, and I've tried a number of things to help keep that in check.  I've gone through a number of different calendar / reminder systems, and they've all worked to some degree for some period of time but none have lasted.  So recently I've been putting people's names in my todo lists, and I've found that when I remind myself of _who_ is affected by my spaciness I'm more likely to put down the fun thing and make sure to fulfill my responsibilities.  Yesterday for example I put _water Emily's plants_ in my todo list instead of just _water plants_ and even though I was in the middle of writing some fun code, I took a break to do it.  I'm excited to see if this works - if so, I might see if I can build some kind of app around it to maybe show pictures of the people on the list."

NOTE: prepare a few and pick one that's appropriate for the company.  If you say "I have a hard time with deadlines" at a consultancy, that's a bad thing :)
