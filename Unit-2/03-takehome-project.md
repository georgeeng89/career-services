#Take Home Test

The following test is an example of an actual Take-Home Code test from a company located in the state of Colorado. In this test, you will have the opportunity to choose the language you're most comfortable with to complete the test. I would suggest starting in Javascript and branching out.

**Note** While you might be comfortable completing the test in Javascript, you're encouraged to try and get the tests to pass in the other languages as well. This company's stack, in particular, uses heavy Scala. In fact, if you pass this code test, you will be asked to learn Scala within a week for the in office interview and complete more code challenges.


##The Test

Click the link and follow the setup directions on the page. Try to get all of the tests to pass as best as you can. Be sure that you can verbally explain all of your code.

**Note** Remember, "Red, Green, Refactor"
