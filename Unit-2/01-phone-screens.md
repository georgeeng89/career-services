# Phone Screens

Junior developers are often weeded out in the first phone interview. Often a company will schedule a short phone call – typically 10 - 30 minutes long – as the first step in their interview process. They do this for a few reasons:

1. To rule out any obvious 'noways'
2. Schedule a technical (or otherwise in-person) interview.

How do companies rule out obvious 'noways'? First, they want to make sure you're not insane. For instance, if you just shout the entire time, or they can hear gunfire and laughter in the background during the call, they don't want to waste their time by having you come in.

Second, they want to make sure you have at least a basic knowledge of their tech stack (or sufficient knowledge in one similar to accomodate) and are legit interested in working for them. To do this, after a brief 'get to know ya', they will often ask you a series of technical questions.

### Example Tech Screen Questions
* What does API stand for and what do they do?
* When was the last time you used a design pattern and how did you apply it? Please explain in depth.
* Do you test drive code?  If so, why?
* Name a company you want to apply to (in real life). Why do you want to be an engineer here?
* Please talk about javascript and Ruby and how they work together in building a web application.
