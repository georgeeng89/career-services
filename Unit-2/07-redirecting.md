# Redirecting

If an interview asks "What's the difference between JSON and BSON?" and you don't know the answer, follow this process:

1. Own it.  Start by immediately saying the words "I don't know"
1. Justify it.  What were you doing _instead_ of learning about BSON?
1. Express interest or curiosity - ask questions.

Example:

Employer: "What's the difference between JSON and BSON"?

You: "I don't know.  Over the past few months I've focused a lot on building client/server apps with Angular and Rails, and I've used JSON as the format for the data that goes between the client and the server.  As a result I feel pretty comfortable with both producing and consuming JSON in JavaScript and Ruby, but I've never heard of BSON.  What does BSON stand for?  What do you do with it at <company name>?"


Try this out with a few other questions you may not know the answer to. Practice with one of your peers.

## Example Questions

* What is Redis good for? When would you use it?
* How do you scale a NoSQL database like Redis or MongoDB?
* What's the difference between Ruby global variables with the dollar-sign, and constants?
* When would you use the Observer Pattern in JavaScript? What other design patterns do you use in your code?
