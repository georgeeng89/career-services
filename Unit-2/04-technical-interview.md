### Technical Interviews

There are many types of technical challenges that interviewers like to put in front of you to gauge your abilities. They range from arbitrary knowledge of library APIs to questions on OO design patterns and data structures to testing your abilities at making fermi calculations.

By the time you get to interview, you either will or won't be prepared for the tests they put you through. There's nothing you can do to cheat in a technical interview, the only thing you can do is control your response to the situation as it is.

**Bad Situation: I lack completely the knowledge or skill to tackle this problem.**

In this situation, it's best to come clean straight away and let the interviewer know that your skillset doesn't extend to solving this particular problem.

The worst thing you can do here is try to lie your way through the problem. Those with technical knowledge in the area you're trying to pull a fast one on, will be able to detect it almost instantly and it will reflect poorly on your interview.

If you find yourself in this situation, be sure to read up on whatever you were caught out on.


**Better Situation: I can probably solve this problem, but may need help/documentation along the way**

Again, be honest. Tell the interviewer what you're not clear on, and repeat the problem back to them. Work through it with them rather than attempt to solve the problem on your own.

In a good interview, most of the questions should be at this difficulty. Watching you apply your technical skills along with your creative and intellectual faculties to a non-trivial problem is the exact reason interviewers conduct technical challenges, so go slowly and make the most of it.


**Best Situation: Give me 20 seconds... done!**

Smaller coding problems like fizzbuzz, 'implement select without select' or 'implement a function that counts all the instances of each class in an array' are the sorts of problems you should quite literally be able to do with your eyes closed.

These sorts of programming challenges are a great opportunity to show off your skills with style. You could write a quick unit test for any function you're asked to write or show off a subtle language feature that they may not have heard of.


**More random advice for doing well at these technical challenges:**

Bring your own laptop. The last thing you want to be worried about in the middle of an interview is getting used to someone else's development environment.
Be honest about your skills. Lying about your abilities or experience is a great deal harder than telling the truth, regardless of the content. Lies require supporting lies, and unless you're a professional con-artist, it's altogether simpler and more effective to work with the truth.

If you get confused or nervous, take a break. No one is going to mark you down for saying "Do you guys mind if I take five minutes to work through this and get back to you?" in middle of the interview. You can use that time to get centred, calm your nerves and work through any problem slowly.

Confirm your assumptions. Interviewers don't correct you if you make subtle mistakes in these tests, so confirm any assumptions you make at every stage of your thinking.
After the interview: As you did with your application, be sure to follow up if the company doesn't get back in touch. Ask for feedback if they decide not to extend an offer right now.
