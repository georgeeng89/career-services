## Lesson Objective:
By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
 - Craft your online brand and describe how it will help you in the job hunt

## Rationale:

Social media profiles are how you market yourself in a career focused manner - it is professional you, online - and the collateral you can share with others or can be viewed passively.

According to a study done by the national job platform JobVite, 94% of employers perform social recruiting during their searches. Who you are online is as important as who you are online. In fact, they are the same person. 

It is very common in industry that regardless of where or how you apply, you can expect your linkedin or github profile to be viewed in the consideration process.

###  Your Story and Your Online Brand

In Unit 1, you started crafting your story and understanding what unique contributions you will be making in your new career. In this unit, we are going to turn to how we will tell that story on various online platforms, which will help to make your brand as a software engineer or data scientist.

Brilliant brands are those that are clear, trustworthy, and identifiable. They are the brands that define customer service - think Southwest Airlines or Nordstrom - or the brands that become synonymous with their entire category - think Kleenex...or even iPhone. You are a brand. And with your admission to Galvanize and your seat in this classroom...your brand is going through a major transformation. Or: levelup. 

You are developing the features of your brand with your classroom curriculum, adding to your technical knowledge, project scope, and production pushes almost daily. And throughout your time at Galvanize, you will refine who your target audience is - the ideal potential employers for you that fit your industry, functional, geographical career goals. 

But before all of that...you have to get the world familiar with your brand. The new you is a software developer or data scientist, and anything a prospective employer can find online feeds (or negates!) that new brand. We will talk about the role of social media, the foundational building blocks of your brand. We are going to start with the three tools to own and announce your professional brand: LinkedIn, GitHub, and Galvanize’s own platform, Talent. As a Galvanize students, these three platforms must be complete, polished, and consistent so that you can launch your brand. Then, we will discuss additional ways that you can continue to build your online presence and make yourself more attractive to recruiters and hiring managers.

### Know What They Know

Before we continue, it’s worth also noting that your personal brand is influenced by a number of online resources. Employers will look at your Facebook profile, and see whatever you have made public (including your profile photo and cover photo!). They will look at your Twitter feed to see what sparks your interest. And sure, they might do a general Google search of you to learn more about the “you” behind your resume. We are not going to spend time asking you to edit what we would consider your personal mediums, though do want you to know - anything on the web will influence your overall brand. 

Take the next five minutes to open an incognito tab on your browser. Start googling yourself. What do you find? Is there anything that surprises you? Anything that you would not want a potential employer to see?

Just as importantly, could you find yourself? Having no presence can be just as damaging as having a less-than-professional online presence. 

Finally, when looking at how you are presented online, right now - would you want to hire yourself as a software engineer or data scientist? Why or why not?

(You make want to now take some time to make certain things private. Unless you have a professionally-curated Facebook page and Instagram account, it’s best that these things are private. Make sure your cover photos and profile pictures are as innocent as possible - avoid anything than anyone could possibly construe as offensive.)

### Tell Your Story

Whether it is called your biography, professional summary, or an About Me section, all three of the talent platforms - LinkedIn, GitHub, and Galvanize Talent - incorporate a narrative about you, and to show a bit of personality. Be engaging, be interesting, and tell a story that includes your background, your decision to join Galvanize, and your future career goals (at the beginning of your Galvanize program, your goal might be to simply land a position as a Data Scientist of Web Development...you can layer in more specifics as you hone in on your optimal industries, specific roles, company size, or geography). 

Though you will tweak this story from platform to platform, we are going to get started now with the basics. 

First, do some research. Go on LinkedIn and find 5 biographies that stand out to you. Why do you find them compelling? What does each author do that you could borrow? Is there anything that you would like to avoid when telling your story?

Next, read the biographies below (from previous Galvanize students). What do you think about each of these? What aspects do you like? What would you want to do differently? What impact does each bio have on you?

1. Data Science: Data Scientist who has built upon 15 years of industry experience in Finance and Portfolio Analytics with cutting-edge skills as a student at Galvanize. I have excelled as a researcher, developer and manager. My mathematics training has allowed me to tackle projects by researching new solutions and applying an analytic perspective. Creator of Tast.io, a content-based restaurant recommender system built using Yelp review text.

2. Web Development: Before becoming a web developer, I obtained a bachelor's in ecology & evolutionary biology at the University of Oklahoma. I worked in a genetics lab for two years and investigating the natural world is still a big passion of mine. Programming has been a really fun transition for me, because it allows me to be creative and think analytically.

In the following exercise, you will pinpoint different parts of your story that will become the pieces of your online, professional brand.
