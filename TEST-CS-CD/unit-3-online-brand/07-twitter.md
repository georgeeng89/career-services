# Using Twitter to Build Your Brand

## Lesson Objectives:
By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
 - Explain how Twitter can be used to build your brand, and on the job hunt.

## Rationale:

Twitter has become synonymous with branding over the past decade. It’s a place where you can interact with professionals in your field, increase your knowledge, and have easy access to people and companies that are otherwise hard to contact - all while building your profile as a software developer or data scientist.

### Understanding Twitter

Twitter is a tool that facilitates conversations and learning - in 140 characters or less. Used correctly, it can be a powerful networking tool, allowing you to show off your brand, build relationships, add value, and connect with influencers. However, because of the short nature of each Twitter posting, it’s especially important to be on-point with everything you do.

### Create a Twitter Profile

First, make sure that your username on Twitter is consistent with your brand elsewhere - it should either obviously be your name, or your GitHub username, if possible.

You have 160 characters to create your bio. Get to the point - use your anchor to describe who you are, and tell your audience something that you’re passionate about. Remember to keep your bio targeted towards your audience - in this case, the software development or data science world, the tech world, and hiring managers. You can also use your bio to mention any accomplishments - if it’s possible to do so in a few words. For example, if you’ve started a business in the past, you can convey that with one word: “Entrepreneur.”

To humanize your profile and show you’re not all business, all the time, you can also add something fun or quirky to your bio - maybe that you love coffee, or are a proud dog parent. 

Use a professional headshot that shows your full face, so that people will recognize you from your LinkedIn profile.

### Start Following People and Companies

When you are just getting going, you will need to lay some groundwork - follow between 50 and 100 accounts that have something to do with the tech industry, companies you are interested in, research in an area that you like or specific technologies you like, tech journalists, or other software engineers or data scientists.

As you get more settled in, you can slow your pace down to about 10 per week.

### Start Interacting

Your goal is to start building relationships with tech influencers - but you want to do it in a way that seems natural and organic, and you do not want to come on too strong. A suggested timeline looks like this:

**Week 1:** Follow an influencer/company
<br>
**Week 2:** Like a tweet
<br>
**Week 3:** Re-tweet a tweet
<br>
**Week 4:** Start a conversation
<br>

### Be Responsive

Things move quickly on Twitter! When you see an interesting article, comment on it quickly. When someone comments on something that you’ve posted, respond quickly.
<br>

### Add Value

As you start getting more followers, it’s important to add value for them - just like in any other area of networking. You can do this by making sure you are posting interesting information that is relevant to your industry. While some of this will be in the form of re-tweets, make sure you are also bringing content onto the site - send a link to an article you just wrote, or something that you saw on LinkedIn or in Tech Crunch. 

In addition to posting content, aim to have 30 - 50% of the things you tweet be original content. What are you thoughts on a topic that’s trending right now? (Try to not be too controversial!) Have you had an interesting experience recently as a software engineer or data scientist? (Build your brand! Create credibility!) Are you struggling with a question on a project that you would like to get some input on? Post it!
<br>

### Use @ and hashtags

You can broaden your audience by engaging with other users directly and by tweeting about trending topics. Start a tweet with @username to alert the other person that you are talking to them. People who are following both of you will see the tweet. To open it up to a broader audience, start it with a period: .@username

Use the hashtag (#) to participate in conversations about an event or a certain topic. When doing so, you should ideally be adding something valuable to the conversation - don’t use this to complain, or to spam out messages (#ineedajob).

### Pro Tip

Make sure you are following the companies that you are most interested in, as well as their recruiters’ personal accounts, and any hiring managers. Start interacting with these people early - way before you are actually looking for a job. If they see you regularly talking about software engineering or data science, you will be validating yourself in their eyes. When the time does come to get a job, you can send a direct message to ask for a referral, or to ask to discuss a position before applying.
