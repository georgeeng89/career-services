# Your GitHub Profile

## Lesson Objectives:
By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
 - Explain what recruiters and hiring managers are looking for in a GitHub profile
 - Tell what makes a compelling ReadMe
 - Update your GitHub profile
<br>
<br>

## Rationale:

Your GitHub profile is where you get to show off a very important part of your brand - your technical competency. Having a well-thought out GitHub can make or break you in the application process (indeed, we’ve had someone get hired off the back of a particularly beautiful ReadMe!).

### Your GitHub Profile

GitHub is a web-based Git repository hosting service, and your portfolio of work. You’re familiar with Git from as early as your first pull request in the program but you may not know that github has a social web interface as well. With recent updates, Github now mimics any other social media platform with the addition of the biography field, and the ability to highlight your repositories and code streaks (both public and private). In our digital professions, it’s become the standard for recruiters and hiring managers to view your Github repositories; Galvanize students will link your Github profile from our resumes and other social media outlets. 

As a current student, you do not have a current company, which is a field in GitHub; denote “Student” as your Company (and Galvanize as your Education!).   

Similar to LinkedIn, GitHub also allows you to follow influencers and signal your industry and professional interest via those that you follow: follow influencers and denote popular repos with your own star. You also signal your interest and ability by contributing to open source projects, demonstrating your coding skills, and demonstrating your proficiency with version control and CLIAs you go through the program. During your time at Galvanize - and through your career - leverage the GitHub repository to manage your code and contribute to the open source community - GitHub is a living profile!

### How do recruiters and hiring managers use GitHub?

You may or may not be surprised to learn that GitHub is a hot recruiting tool within the software development world. Recruiters spend hours scouring GitHub profiles - either through searching within GitHub, or by finding interesting candidates on LinkedIn, and visiting their GitHub profiles to see if their work matches up.

You will often find that recruiters without technical backgrounds will spend most of their time looking at your ReadMe’s, while hiring managers will often dive into your code bases. 

Here are some of the big **warning signs** that recruiters look out for:

* Unmodified forks of common open-source projects
* Only having coding tutorials from your class that are the same as everyone else’s
* Code re-solves common problems instead of using existing open-source libraries and frameworks
* Obvious cut-and-paste code
* All contributions are very recent
* Contributions are only minor changes in documentation

Some **positive signs** that recruiters like to see include:

* Projects are well-organized and easy to navigate
* Code is clean and appropriately commented
* Projects show understanding of basic design
* Code makes use of existing open-source libraries and frameworks
* ReadMe clearly describes project
* Tests
* Consistent activity for several months/years

As you can see, many of these things are not quick fixes, and are things that you will need to consistently work on throughout the course. For now, let’s focus on getting your profile updated.

### Check for the Basics

Make sure that your GitHub has the following…

* High quality headshot (same standard as LinkedIn)
* Biography section that relates to your technical career
* 5 Pinned repositories
* Contact Info 
* (optional) Location 
* Available for Hire is turned On
<br>

### Rules for GitHub

Make it easy to find more information on you. Link to your LinkedIn - and some people even choose to showcase their resume in a repo!

Write detailed and clear ReadMe’s for your projects - see more on this below!

Aim for production-quality code. While recruiters will mostly be focusing on your ReadMes, hiring managers will often look at your code...and you don’t always get to choose what they will look at! So clean out your GitHub. If you have a lot of repos on there that you would prefer to not be judged by, get rid of them.

Speaking of which, it’s good to not have too many forks that you’ve done nothing with. It clutters up your account and can make it more difficult for people to find your projects. Try to make sure that for everything you showcase on your GitHub profile, you have a clear explanation for how you have contributed to it.

### GitHub Pro Tips

* Add emojis to your repos, use the shortcut CTRL + CMD + Space = Emoji Keyboard. Don’t go crazy with your emojis; let your technical work be the real visual! 
* Commit to GitHub daily so that your contributions shows that you are active (this is depicted as dark green on your home page)...and make them relevant commits.
* Find open-source projects and contribute. Even if it’s just a correction of a spelling error or syntax, the technical community will see that you’re contributing to the community!
* Make sure that your repos are public. (Check with your instructors to make sure what you are working on can be shared!) If all your projects are private, nobody will be able to see the hard work you’ve been doing.

### How do you write a good ReadMe?

For each project you do at Galvanize, you should have a detailed ReadMe in GitHub. As noted above, this is one of the first things that recruiters will look at when they are considering you as a candidate. Therefore, your ReadMe should be written in a way that it appeals to two audiences: the technical recruiter, who wants to understand the way you think through problems and understand the projects you’ve worked on, and the hiring manager, who will want to know about interesting technical problems you’ve worked with.

Think of your GitHub ReadMe almost like a science project write up from grade school. You will want to explain what you set out to do, the method you took for accomplishing it, difficulties and challenges you faced along the way - and how you worked around them, and the product you ended up with - and any changes you may want to make in the future. 

Don’t be afraid to break up large blocks of text with images and code snippets - this can really help your ReadMe come to life!

Here are some topics you can cover in a well-written ReadMe:

* Introduction - give an overview of what you wanted to accomplish with your project, and what motivated you to build it.
* Table of Contents, to make everything else easier to find
* How it is set up - what software needs to be installed, how to get the developer environment running
* How is it used? Be very specific - this can be a great place to use images!
* Technical details about the stack, testing, etc. Also - what challenges came up during this project, and how did you work around them?
* What would you do next?
