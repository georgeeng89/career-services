By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

* Sign in to Talent

## Rationale:

Talent is another part of your online brand - and one that is unique to Galvanize. You will be using it extensively once you are on the job hunt, so it’s important to understand how it works!

Every time the careers team refers you for a job, it will be through your Talent profile.

### What is Talent?

Talent (talent.galvanize.com) is Galvanize's proprietary hiring platform, showcasing our data science and web development students from across all of our campuses, and inviting employers to connect with that talent. As a Galvanize student student ready to launch your new career, Galvanize Talent is your tool through which you market yourself and your skills, all under the Galvanize umbrella.

Talent is your place for finding and managing positions. It’s more than a job board (everyone has a job board); every position that you see on Talent has been sent to us directly from one of our hiring partners or it has been identified by one of our internal team members as a position that fits Galvanize talent.

While you will see job postings from companies posting directly to Talent - signalling that they want to see Galvanize students and graduates applying to their positions! - there are more than 240 companies with active Talent accounts, accessing the database and searching through your profile background, skills, education and projects, looking for potential matches. For a company, Talent is not just a place to post a position -- it’s a destination for web development and data science talent.

To have a complete profile in Talent - meaning a profile that is ready-for-primetime and viewable by potential employers, you must have the following: 

* Headshot/Profile image
* About Me (the Talent version of the biography)
* At least one entry in Education (Galvanize = one!) 
* At least one role listed in Experience
* LinkedIn URL
* GitHub URL
* At least one technical Project

**You do not need to fill out your profile now - we will be doing that in Unit 7. For now, just focus on accessing your account, and understanding the different features Talent has.**

On the first day of your cohort, you received an invitation email with the subject: “Welcome to Galvanize (Your First Name)!”. This email is sent to the email address associated to your main Galvanize account - so the one with which you applied to Galvanize. 

Once you have created your  “Galvanize Account”, you now have access to the Members Portal (members.galvanize.com) and (students.galvanize.com). You will see a “Thank You” page allowing you to navigate to either site. Click into Talent (talent.galvanize.com), and you will need to click the “Sign In” link to create a profile. 

Here are some tips to make the most of the system!

### Partner Jobs vs. Public Jobs

There are different kinds of jobs posted on Talent. Some of them, Partner Jobs, are jobs where we have a pre-existing relationship with companies who are looking to hire, and they post jobs specifically in search of Galvanize students. Partner Jobs are the hottest leads, and when you apply, we can also recommend you across to the company in question.

There are also a number of Public Jobs on Talent. This means that they are not necessarily associated with companies we are working with (yet). We have public jobs on Talent to bring more relevant positions to your attention, whether or not we have a working relationship with the company. Many of the Public Jobs companies later become Partner Companies.

### Talent Auto Cover Letter

Talent allows you to create a template cover letter to make applying to different jobs quick and easy. Remember that you should still customize this cover letter from job to job. On the employer side, it is VERY obvious which students have taken the time to make little tweaks to their cover letters to customize them for different companies, and it makes a big difference.

### Referrals through Talent

Sometimes our partner companies will ask us to recommend some students for certain jobs, based on skill sets or interests. This is one reason why it’s so important that you let the careers team know what industries and types of roles you are interested in, and make sure that you give a full overview of your skill sets on Talent. 

When you are recommended for a position, you will receive an email notification telling you that you have been recommended. At that point, it’s important that you follow the steps to apply for the job right away to be considered and to get into the company’s ATS.

### Checking Talent Daily

New jobs are posted on Talent around the country every day. In addition to looking at the digests you will be sent, you should make a point of checking what’s new on Talent every morning. People who apply to jobs within 24 hours of them being posted have the best chance of getting a response. 
<br>

### Searching for Jobs

As mentioned, Talent has jobs that are located throughout the company, and especially in areas where we have other Galvanize campuses (New York, Denver, Boulder, Seattle, Phoenix, Austin, San Francisco). If you are open to ANY of these locations you should search for jobs and apply to them.

### Have a strong profile 

Pay attention to the Talent checklist and make sure your profile is as strong as possible. When our partner companies sign up, we allow them to both post jobs AND search through our database of active students. Students who have complete, thoughtful profiles get much more attention through company searching than students who have not put time into their profiles.
