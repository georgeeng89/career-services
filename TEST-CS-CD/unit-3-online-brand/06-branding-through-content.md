## Rationale:

Content creation is one of the most powerful ways to send the message that you are actively engaged in your field. It creates the social proof that you know what you are talking about, and shows people - such as hiring managers, recruiters, or other potential connections - that you are passionate about what you’re doing. You’re more than just another bootcamp grad looking for a job! Furthermore, content is a great launchpad for creating discussions and building your network.

### Why is content important?

First impressions are made quickly. When you meet someone in person, that first impression is made in less than 10 seconds, and is based off a mix of what you say and how you say it. 

Similarly, online first impressions are made quickly. You’ve spent time crafting a great LinkedIn profile - and other online profiles - that tell your story. Your profile hopefully passes the interesting test (if you looked at your profile for 5 seconds, would you reach out? Would you want to hire yourself?). One of the things that can help push someone from “maybe” to “yes, definitely!” is consistent, thoughtful content.

Recruiters and hiring managers are always looking for proof that they are making a good hire. Hiring is expensive - and hiring a bad candidate is so expensive that companies create ever longer and more complex hiring processes, willing to risk several false negatives to avoid that false positive. This fear can be even greater with graduates from bootcamps and similar programs. After all, what if you’re just in the field for the money, as opposed to passion? What if you decide it’s not for you?

The content you create will help build confidence that you actually know what you are talking about, and that you are mentally engaged in the industry. It allows you to make a great first impression before you ever get to the interview stage, and allows everyone you’re connected with to know that this is your field of expertise.

### LinkedIn Posts

The easiest, and most basic, kind of content creation is a LinkedIn post. These are short-form posts intended to give information, share your opinion, or start a conversation. Here are some things to keep in mind when writing LinkedIn posts:

* **Timing.** Frequency is key, but you also don’t want to overwhelm people so they start to think of you as a spammer. Aim for 2 - 3 thoughtful, well-crafted posts per week.
* **Keep it professional.** This isn’t Facebook! Leave the updates about your personal life for another platform. Keep this focused on your professional career. Also, this isn’t the time or place to get political or discuss sensitive topics.
* **Know your audience.** The idea of building your brand through posts isn’t that you’re going to be engaging every single person - even every single person in technology. What are you interested in? Which group of people within the tech world do you most want to address? Craft your post so that you are talking directly to them. 
* **Length.** Ideally, a LinkedIn post should be long enough to say something, but you also don’t want it to be so long that it deserves to be an article. A good guideline is to aim for between 50 and 200 words. 
* **Hashtags.** Just like Twitter and Facebook, LinkedIn uses hashtags on its posts to make content searchable. If you know you are contributing to part of a larger discussion, feel free to use the hashtag to make your comment easier to find.
* **Images.** A picture can add a lot to a post - just make sure to keep it professional! This is especially nice if it is a picture of you doing something industry-relevant - such as attending a conference, with an accompanying post about what you found valuable there.
* **Ask Questions.** Ending your post with a question is a great idea to encourage discussion in the comments. Always end with an ask - “What do you guys think?” - to increase engagement. The more likes and comments you have, after all, the more your post will become visible to other people, which will not only build your brand, but will also likely lead to new connections.

### Writing Articles

In addition to short-form posts, writing longer articles is a great way to build your brand and get noticed on LinkedIn - and elsewhere. Once you have written an article, you should promote it - you can get it on Medium, tweet it to your followers on Twitter, etc.

Many of the same rules apply when writing an article. You want to keep it relevant to your industry and your specific audience. When you’re brainstorming what to write about, ask yourself what kind of content catches your eye, and what you would want to see from a potential hire.

Here are some tips to get you started:

* **Length.** For an article, aim for 750+ words
* **Read a lot, and copy a style you like.** What resonates with you when you’re reading someone else’s work, or other blog posts on LinkedIn? Instead of worrying about immediately finding your own voice, you can get started by standing on the shoulders of giants - imitate the writing style of someone you admire. 
* **Start with an outline.** It can be much easier to write when you have an idea of where you want to go. Start with an outline of the main idea you want to talk about, and the details and topics you are going to use to support the idea. 
* **Get a second pair of eyes.** It’s always a good idea to have someone read over what you have written - they can offer critical feedback about logic gaps in your argument, writing flow, organization, and general content. Medium has a great tool for this: you can start your draft here (https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/214874698-Drafts) and share it with others for review here (https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/215564177-Share-a-draft). 
* **Use writing tools.** There are many great writing tools out there that you should check out, including the following:
  * **PowerThesaurus:** https://www.powerthesaurus.org/
  * **WordCounter**, which not only counts your words, but also gives you approximate reading times: https://wordcounter.net/

### Types of Articles

If you’re not sure what you want to write about, use the following as some ideas:

* **Write about a project or case study.** You’re going to work on several interesting case studies and projects throughout this course. Explain your process - what was the idea and goal going in? How did you decide to tackle it? What challenges came up along the way? What did you end up with? (This can be one of the easiest to write, since you will already have a project ReadMe on GitHub that you can draw from!)
* **Write about learning a new technology.** Did you need to learn Docker for your capstone? What was it like? How did you go about learning it quickly - and using it right away? What interesting challenges did you face?
* **Write about your opinion about something happening in the tech space, or your opinion about a trend in technology.** Start with telling what your opinion is, what experience or evidence you have to back it up, and what contrasting opinions you think are out there and why they aren’t as good as your opinion. This is a great one to end with a question - open it up to your audience. What do they think?
* **Write about your personal journey in tech.** This is a time to tell your story! How did you come to be here? What do you want to do? What have you learned and how are you using it so far?
* **Review.** Read a book, take a course, or try a new technology. What do you think about it?
