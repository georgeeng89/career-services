# Reaching Out to Your Online Network

## Pre-requisites: 
* A completed LinkedIn profile
<br>
<br>

## Lesson Objectives:
By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
* Explain some strategies to quickly start building out your online network
* Write a sample cold outreach message
<br>
<br>

## Rationale:

Now that you’ve started building your online brand, you can start networking online. Like in-person networking, the goal is the same: make a connection and start a relationship. While the reward for building a strong online network can be huge - especially when it comes time for the job search - there are a few challenges to online networking that you must address to be successful.

Before you start reaching out to new people to grow your online network, start where you’ll get the biggest gains with the least effort. In the next week, try to get at least 50 connections, if you don’t have them already. After that, slowly try to work your way up to 500 by the end of the course.

### Expand Your LinkedIn Network With People You Already Know

Keep in mind that both quality and quantity count when it comes to LinkedIn connections! If you randomly add a lot of connections, there is little chance that you will be able to call on them in the future for things like informational interviews. Similarly, many of the best uses of LinkedIn are only unlocked once you reach a certain number of connections - such as being able to see which employees work at certain target companies. 

To get started with building out your LinkedIn network, first add the people who you already know. Even if they are friends or family members who have nothing to do with the tech industry, they may have connections that will be useful to you later on, and will allow your 2nd and 3rd degree network to stretch further.

Also be sure to add the people you have met so far at Galvanize: your instructors, career services managers, admissions advisors, and your classmates.

### When Someone Connects With You

As you start building your network, you may start to realize that some people connect with you, as well! Some students find it confusing - or even slightly disturbing - when they first start receiving connecting requests from people they don’t know.

For now, since you are in hypergrowth mode, you should be open to adding anyone who connects with you. If the person gives you reason to think that he or she has unprofessional intentions, you are always welcome to block or report the person when that becomes clear!

Use the invite as an opportunity to start a conversation! When you accept the request, send a quick message: “Hi Lewis! Thanks for connecting. What about my profile caught your eye? Please let me know if there’s anything I can do to help you out!”

### Interact Through Posts and Groups

As you start to build up your network on LinkedIn, keep in mind that it’s an interactive platform - and in more ways than just through messages.

People will take notice of your actions on posts and groups, and these are both great ways to quickly and easily start to build your brand and get to know others. In Lesson 6 we will talk more about content creation for brand building, including posting on LinkedIn. 

For now, start to participate in discussions. When someone writes something interesting about the industry, comment on it. Ask questions. Show you’re an engaged member of the industry!

This can also be a great way to find other people who are interested in the same things you are. As you see other people posting and participating in conversations, reach out to them to connect. You now have a perfect ice-breaker: “I liked reading your post on LinkedIn about Machine Learning. I’m looking to connect with interesting people, and would love to add you to my network!”

### Galvanize Alumni Network

As a Galvanize student, you now have easy access to the entire Galvanize alumni network through LinkedIn. This is another group that you should start to reach out to as soon as possible. Engage with alumni in conversations about their Galvanize experience, and learn more about what they are doing in industry.

Since they have gone through the exact same experience that you are now going through, our alumni are excellent resources for learning how to cope with the stress of the program and a career change, and have valuable insights into how the skills you are learning can be used on the market. 

Our alumni are great subjects for informational interviews. Remember that they are also working professionals - be respectful of their time and be prepared to ask meaningful questions.

### Cold LinkedIn Outreach and Emails - When, Why, & How

Though you will start building your online relationships through warm leads, at some point you will likely find yourself reaching out completely cold - either on LinkedIn or over email. While many cold messages will be ignored, you shouldn’t get discouraged! Here are some tips to help make your cold outreach as successful as possible.

* **Start building relationships with cold outreach subjects way before you need them.**

One surefire way to start a relationship off on the wrong foot, or to turn someone off, is to ask for a favor right away. If you wait until you are looking for a job to start building up your network, you will find that it is actually much more difficult than it otherwise could have been! Many people - especially those who work for popular companies - are inundated with requests for referrals. Instead, treat people you meet online like you would with people you might meet at any other networking event. Focus on how you can add value for them instead of asking for favors.

* **Think about the kind of people who can help you in the future**

As you start looking at people you want to connect with, it’s good to have a strategy in mind. Are you looking to be a software engineer? Perhaps more specifically, you want to learn more about front end engineering, and have some interest in UX/UI. Start looking for people who are specifically involved in that world. This might include quite a range - from people who are new in the field, to those who are seasoned professionals and thought leaders, to hiring managers at companies you are interested in, to recruiters who focus on those fields. Start building these connections early, so that you will have a strong and useful network in place when the time comes to look for a job.

* **Interact first**

As mentioned in the previous section, you may have a lot more success in connecting with people if you make a point of interacting with them ahead of time. Make a comment on an article they have written, or engage in a discussion on LinkedIn. Or take it off LinkedIn - connect instead with someone on Twitter, find a Medium post they have recently published, or a project on their GitHub. This will all give you great conversation starters when you do connect on LinkedIn.

* **Find what you have in common**

LinkedIn has enough information that you can probably find something you have in common with your person of interest. Use this information when you introduce yourself - you are much more likely to get a response from someone when you have something in common! Remember, these don’t need to be strictly technical commonalities - perhaps you went to the same school, volunteer for the same charity, had the same past job or worked for the same company, or have a similar passion project.

Use this information when reaching out: *“Hey Gina, I noticed that we both studied Classics - I just wanted to comment on that since it’s so rare to see that in the tech world! How did you make the transition to engineering? Would love to add you to my network.”*

* **Namedrop people you both know**

Similarly, it can be very effective to mention any connections you have in common. If you do this, make sure the person you are namedropping would have an idea of who you are, just in case they get asked: *“Hi Gina! I saw that we both know John King, and that we are in similar industries. I’m looking to connect with interesting people and would love to add you to my network!”*

* **Find something interesting about the person - and use a bit of flattery**

The same rule applies here as when networking in person: you can make someone feel good about themselves - and about you - by seeming genuinely interested in what they are doing or working on! If you have nothing in common you can mention when you reach out, instead find something about the person that is really interesting. It might be their job, career path, an article they have written, a piece of technology they are an expert in…

Use that when you reach out to start the conversation: *“Hi Gina! I saw the article you posted recently on neural networks to predict stock price and thought it was fascinating! I’m currently working on a neural nets project and would love to connect.”*

* **Follow up**

After you have sent the initial connection invite, you will start to get some positive responses. Don’t stop there! After you are connected to someone on LinkedIn, you can follow up with longer direct messages. Don’t overwhelm your new contacts with too much attention all at once. Build the relationship by interacting with people through articles, posts, and comments. Then start reaching out to your contacts with personalized notes, and try to get some informational interviews. Again, this will be most successful if you do this before you are actively on the job market.

### Cold emailing

Sometimes, email can be even better for introductions to someone you don’t know. If you are emailing someone you don’t know, make sure to concisely explain who you are and why you are contacting them. If someone is introducing you to another person through email, reach out to the new contact to explain why you wanted an introduction. With a little digging, you can find the email addresses of hiring managers, recruiters, department managers and many other people who could help you. 

There are several ways to find someone’s email address. You can start off with looking on their various social media profiles - many people will post their emails on LinkedIn, Twitter, GitHub, or their personal web site. If you can’t find the email, try using sites that help with that, such as https://hunter.io/ or https://findthatlead.com/. 

In the subject line of your email, get to the point quickly - there is no need to be overly creative! If you are interested in learning more about the data science work going on at Uber, you might use something such as: “Your data science experience at Uber”

The body of your email should consist of a few simple parts:
  * Why is this person in particular interesting to you?
  * What do you have in common OR how can you add value?
  * Call to action

Here is an example:
  
*Hi Eva,*

*I saw that you run workshops that are helping women in tech find mentorship. I’m currently doing research on how large companies in Silicon Valley are trying to decrease the gender gap in tech, and I think your work would be really insightful for what I’m working on.*

*I also saw you’re looking for some volunteers for your next meetup in October, and I would be happy to help out in any way that’s useful!*

*Are you available next week for a quick coffee and a chat - say Tuesday at 3 pm?*

*Thanks and speak soon,*

*Mary Ann*

<br>
Remember, **keep the focus on the other person - make it about them, not all about you!**

Many times, your cold emails will get ignored. Sometimes, people just aren’t interested - but the most common reason is simply that people get busy, and forget to reply. Therefore, you should always send a follow-up email. Wait a week after the original email. 


*Hi Eva,*

*I wanted to follow up on my email from last week about a request for a chat to learn more about your insights into mentorship programs. As I mentioned, I’m doing research in a similar area, and I think the work you’re doing right now is fascinating. I’m happy to meet up whenever and wherever is convenient for you - but if you’re too busy, I completely understand!*

*Thanks, and looking forward to hearing from you soon,*

*Mary Ann*
