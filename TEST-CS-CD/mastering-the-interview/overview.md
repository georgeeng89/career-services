# Mastering the Interview

## Unit Objective

By the end of this unit, you will be able to confidently and insightfully engage with all elements of the job interview process, including technical and soft-skills queries. 

## Unit Overview

Getting a job can be a long process where your character and skills are investigated on many levels. You do not have to ace every question, but falling hard in one area can be enough to put you out of the running. This unit examines the ways in which companies try to understand your technical capabilities and soft-skills as they determine if you are a good fit for their team.
