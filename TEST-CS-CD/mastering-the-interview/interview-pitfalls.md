# Common Interview Pitfalls 

## Objectives: 
By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
 - Name 10 common interview pitfalls and how to avoid each one

## Rationale:

In order to be as successful as possible during an interview, in addition to demonstrating your ability to solve technical challenges, you should also establish rapport with your interviewer(s) and do an exceptional job communicating your thought process throughout the entirety of the technical portion. Because you may not have much experience at these particular skills from your experience writing code, a few pitfalls you must look out for during interviews might be unintuitive. By learning what these pitfalls are, you can make choices to avoid them, and better perform in your interviews.

### Interview Pitfalls

These first 3 pitfalls address the important objective of developing rapport with your interviewer, signaling to them that you will be a pleasant team member who they can look forward to working with for a long time to come.

### Pitfall #1 - Acting as if you're not already part of the team

At the end of an interview, you want your interviewers to look forward to their next encounter with you, and to have pleasant feelings when imagining you on their team. Always interact with your interviewer as if you are already a well-settled member of their team. Especially if you are still working on calming your nerves before interviews, or believing that there is a scarcity of job offerings out in the market for you, this can be a challenge. However, treating your interviewer as somebody qualitatively superior to you, or as if they are the only one that has something of value to offer you, and not vice versa, will result in awkward interactions and a difficult-to-pin-down sentiment on the part of the interviewer that will affect their choice to have you back or not.

You may find it helpful to recall experiences you've had in social settings with your fellow web developer friends where you have geeked out delightfully trying to solve something intellectually challenging. This is exactly the right attitude to carry into your interview. If you enjoy the problem solving you can expect this feeling to be contagious, and your interviewer will look forward to engaging with you in the wealth of challenges that will arrive in your working together.

### Pitfall #2 - Poor eye contact

In the same spirit of building rapport with your interviewer, make it a point to engage in friendly eye contact with them throughout the course of the interview. A common pitfall to this seemingly easy objective is during the part of the interview when you are thinking very hard about or working very diligently on a technical problem. At the whiteboard, or when in front of a computer, try to notice when you've completed a thought, and look directly at your interviewer, as if you've said or done something pleasant. In addition to building rapport, making certain to do this also gives you many opportunities to follow non-verbal cues the interviewer might be sending you. Anxious interviewees can go on for many minutes in a direction that is entirely uninteresting to an interviewer if they are not looking at their counterpart, unfortunately creating a long series of losses, and contributing to the interviewer's sentiment that you do not effectively work together with others.

### Pitfall #3 - Poor appearance

Tech attire tends to be casual, but sharp and clean. Even if you've been interviewing hard for weeks, make it a part of your work to groom and dress well before interviewing. If this is scary territory for you, seek out friends whose appearance you appreciate for advice. You'll be surprised at the challenge and the benefits of upping your grooming game.

Avoiding the following 4 pitfalls supports approaching technical problems in a way that sets you up for success, makes the ubiquitous requirement to pivot easy, and allows you to demonstrate your clear and well-organized thought process to the interviewer.

### Pitfall #4 - Not clarifying the problem

An understandable, though problematic, anti-pattern is receiving a challenge to solve and imagining you must solve it as fast as possible, letting nothing stand in the way of your immediate production of perfect code. In truth, software engineering is difficult, and as you know, requires calm methodical thinking. One such place that such calm methodical thinking is essential is in understanding what a problem entails. When given a problem to solve, before anything else, confirm the inputs and outputs of the problem with your interviewer, whether or not there are any time or space constraints, and seek out any ambiguities in the problem statement, clarifying them with the interviewer before beginning. Technical interview problems often contain such ambiguities by intention. Taking the time to clarify them before working to solve the problem demonstrates that you are capable of sophisticated thinking, are able to approach ambiguous problem spaces, and are not likely to waste days of work by writing code that addresses the wrong problem, a common but expensive mistake.

### Pitfall #5 - Writing code too early

After clarifying the problem, the next appropriate step is to explore the problem at a whiteboard as visually as possible, followed by the writing of pseudocode, and concluding with the composition of actual code. In many interview settings you will in fact be working only at a whiteboard, and will not be expected to write actual code (something like a take home challenge, or another section of the interview process, or a review of existing code might be utilized for this). Especially at a whiteboard, changing course is cumbersome: erasing and scribbling in new code in the margins. Additionally, the act of solving a problem is challenging enough without the act of translating this solution into code. Why not break it up into distinct steps? Similarly, pseudocode is easy to refactor, and will disclose aspects of the solution that had not occurred to you yet. Writing code that is already mapped-out by pseudocode, which is informed by a visual exploration of a clarified problem space often results in code that works on the first go. This is a magic scenario that indicates just the kind of intelligence and method interviewers are looking for.

### Pitfall #6 - Going for the most elegant solution first

This is another understandable anti-pattern, wishing to demonstrate genius by writing an exceptionally elegant solution off the bat. Don't do this in interviews, and don't do this in your work either. Assuming you have clarified the problem and explored a viable approach, write the easiest to write, and easiest to read solution first. Refactor to optimize for elegance, conciseness, and performance, after you have a working, albeit mundane, solution. This process indicates discipline, and sets the stage for you actually delivering a solution under time constraint. Just like in the job, shipping a working product trumps all else, and don't worry, assuming you solve the problem naively, you may have plenty of time left, in addition to better perspective on the problem, to demonstrate a brilliant refactor, or at least speak about one without actually having to implement it.

### Pitfall #7 - Not speaking constantly while problem solving

More important than your ability to solve a given problem is your ability to think clearly such that you can solve any problem. Interviewers need to know what your thinking is like, and how well you are able to articulate it to others, such as your future teammates. Unlike working on code solo, during an interview, you must insist on speaking about your thinking at all times during the technical portion. Silence should be avoided at all costs. Once you experience going silent during an interview, you will have a felt sense about why it must be avoided; it indicates being stuck, a lack of productiveness, a lack of creativity, and the quality of being inarticulate.

This skill takes practice. In particular, being willing to speak when you are not clear on how to proceed is often unintuitive. This, however, is a golden opportunity. Every engineer is working to solve problems that do not have a clear objective, when you are faced with such a situation during an interview, speak out loud about what options you are considering, which parts of the problem seem challenging, and intuitions you have. Be as accurate and honest as possible regarding your confidence level about solutions you are considering, and don't be at all shy about changing your thinking when something becomes more clear to you. A sign of a bright engineer is knowing when they don't know, and when to change course.

The last 3 pitfalls are obvious, but carry such heavy consequence that they must be mentioned.

### Pitfall #8 -  Self-deprecating

Even if you believe you are doing so in a humorous or charming way, do not speak ill of yourself or self-deprecate. Such behavior is entirely unproductive.

### Pitfall #9 - Lying or exaggerating

As much as you need to present yourself as attractively as possible, you must not lie or even exaggerate. It's a small world, and word gets around. Dishonesty about prior contributions or accomplishments, or even misrepresenting whether or not you are familiar with a given technology or problem will come back around a destroy your reputation, potentially irrevocably. There's absolutely no shame in your current station, own it.

### Pitfall #10 - Taking rejection or critique personally

You can't control who the interviewer is and unfortunately, you're likely to run into some not-so-nice interviewers on occasion. Meeting such people at an interview is better than finding out you have to work with them closely after a hire, so count such encounters as good luck and a clear sign that a given company might not be up to your own standards.

During an interview you might receive criticism that is entirely appropriate and kindly delivered. You should welcome such feedback, recognizing that it is a boon to get to work with others who complement your own thought process. It can be easy to take this as an indication that you should freak out and give up, but don't do this. Remember, again, that time with a good friend when you challenged and clarified each other's' thoughts, and proceed gracefully, incorporating the feedback that you should hope someday to repay.
