# Common interview questions

Non-technical questions can run the gamut from “tell me about a time when you had to manage conflicting instructions on a project” to “where do you see yourself in five years?” Reviewing application materials, job descriptions, and public company info will identify potential interview questions, and help you prepare your own practice questions. To prepare, we will run through a few common questions, and how you should answer them.

Note that you will need actual stories to back up your answers for most of these questions. It’s a good idea to think of these stories in advance, write them out, and then think of which questions you could apply them to. 

**Sample Question: Tell Me About Yourself**

“Tell me about yourself” is almost always asked during the soft skill portion of an interview, often kicking off the conversation. This allows you to highlight the pieces of your own background that are relevant to the job. And the great news: the answer to the Tell me about yourself question is also your personal pitch that you refined earlier in your networking. 

Because the prompt is open ended, it can feel difficult to know how much you should disclose to the interviewer. But it’s simple! You only need to communicate the following: your background, the evolution of how you got into web development/data science, and your specific qualifications for the job that you’re interviewing for (which can be determined based on the job description).

**Sample Question: Why Are You Changing Careers?**

Employers want to know your motives—and also see if things ended badly with your last job—which could be a warning for them. Stay positive. Talk about your enthusiasm for the roles that you’re pursuing now rather how you disliked your past jobs, coworkers, employers, pay, etc.

**Sample Question: Why Do You Want to Work Here?**

Employers want to work with people who are enthusiastic about their company and team—not just any company. To answer this question well, learn about the company that you’re interviewing with and find things that you like about its product, people, and mission, etc. Articulating your knowledge of and excitement about the company that you’re interviewing for shows the interviewer that you take the interview seriously and are on the same page as them.

**Sample Question: What Are You Looking For?**

Employers ask this question to determine if you want the same thing—if you’re interested in the job that you’re interviewing for... or if you just want to use it to get to the job that you really want or will take whatever you can get. Obviously, they want someone who is happy to work indefinitely at the job that you’re interviewing for so that they won’t soon need to be rehiring for this position.

To show the employer that you want the job that you’re interviewing for, include its title in your response. E.g. if you’re applying for a front-end role, you could say, “Right now I’m interested in a junior role as a front-end developer.” Optionally, include something about company culture that’s important to you, E.g. the opportunity for mentorship.


**Sample Question: Tell me about a project.**

Recruiters who ask this are trying to gauge the depth of your technical knowledge and see if you’ve worked on the kinds of projects that are relevant to what their team is doing; they also are often interested in hearing how interested you sound in your work. As discussed in the previous lesson, make sure that you don’t keep your description too high-level - the recruiter will need to hear technical details to feel that you know what you are talking about. Also, focus on results.

For hiring managers, expect follow-up questions on the technical things that you mention.

**Sample Question: Tell me about your work experience, OR Walk me through your resume.**

The resume walkthrough question is asking for a high-level version of your story where you start with your earliest work experience, and lead your interviewer to what you’re doing now. You don’t need to just repeat everything on the resume; instead, help your interviewer see the connecting thread that makes your story consistent and make sure that you use this as an opportunity to explain what got you interested in data science or web development, and why you are interviewing for their role in particular.

**Sample Question: Tell me about your education, or Why did you decide on a degree in x?**

Tell your interviewer what sparked your passion for your educational path (keeping in mind that there are bad motivators to talk about, such as doing a degree just because your parents told you to, or you wanted to make a lot of money). Mention anything relevant that you learned in that degree, and how that led to your career path and eventually to either data science or web dev at Galvanize.

If your degree is totally unrelated, this still works, because it’s interesting to hear about people’s unrelated passions, as well. Tell about interesting things you did, and highlight any transferable knowledge or skills that you got. (For example - my degree in Latin gave me great attention to detail; my literature degree involved a lot of philosophy, which trained me in critical thinking.)

**Sample Question: Why are you making a career change?**

Similar question - this is asking you to tell your story, with an emphasis on the motivational piece. What galvanized (ha!) you to be here?

**Sample Question: What did you like most about your last job? Least about your last job?**

For what you liked most: if possible, focus on an element of your job that is somehow related to what you are pursuing now, or shows you as a valuable team member/important to the business. For example, “I really enjoyed analyzing customer activity as we were building out products, and using those insights to make suggestions about new features that we should build.” or: “The company culture was fantastic - we had a very open communication style on my team, and because of that could function well together and support each other to get projects done efficiently.”

For what you liked least: make sure this is totally unrelated to the job at hand! For example, if you are applying to at startup, and you tell them that you really disliked the lack of organizational structure at your previous job, it’s not going to go down well. (And if that is the case - maybe you shouldn’t be applying to startups!) Also avoid things that will make you look like a difficult employee or bad team member (i.e., “I really disliked how I had to work with other people on projects.”) Remember: Never get negative about other people on your team!

**Sample Question: What kind of supervisor do you like to work for? OR Who was your best boss? Who was your worst boss?**

Always ask yourself, “Why are they asking me this question?” If you’re asked this question, your interviewer is probably trying to understand if you will function well with their managerial style, and if you’ve been able to have productive relationships with your managers in the past. 

Giving an honest answer will also help you to understand if you’ll be a good fit at the company. However, avoid putting anything into too extreme terms, because this can easily be misinterpreted. Using a specific example can really help answer - and try to go positive instead of negative. For example, “My last boss was great because she was so emotionally intelligent, and I appreciated that a lot about her. Whenever you talked to her, she was able to make you feel like you really mattered. She also had a really mature understanding of business and it was great to be able to pick her brain, and grow my own business awareness. She gave me a lot of good ideas for the kind of manager I would like to be someday.” or: “My boss at Uber was great because he gave me enough room to struggle and learn on my own. He didn’t always just want to give me an answer - he would let me figure it out on my own, and because of that, I’m much better now at tackling problems, being aware of my own thought processes, and making confident contributions.”

Notice how different that last example is to something like: “I don’t like to be micromanaged. If someone were to tell me what to do all the time, it would drive me crazy.”

Always keep it positive!

Keep this same thing in mind when answering the question about your worst boss. Any time you get negative, your future potential boss will definitely notice! Instead, focus on specific reasons that you didn’t excel as much under a certain management style, and explain what you did about it. This is not the time to air your grievances about people you didn’t like.

For example:

“I haven’t had any horrible bosses or anything like that. I feel a little bad actually picking someone! But one of my bosses that I had a Blue Shield was a micromanager and so I personally didn’t grow as much when I was working under her. I completely understand why it happened - she was under a lot of pressure to be delivering reports on certain metrics that had been demanded from higher up. And really, she was a great person and super smart, but the stress of how the role was structured meant that she just became hyper-focused on those metrics, and so for everyone on her team, she just had to stay on top of us at all times. I know that it was actually a super frustrating experience for everyone involved. As a result, I didn’t have enough ownership over what I was doing to feel like I was learning a lot. Fortunately, I was able to talk to her about how I felt during one of our 1:1s, and while there wasn’t a lot she could do within the structure of that role, it was great that she was able to acknowledge how I felt and she did try to give me some more creative tasks that would be more challenging for me and that were more open-ended. And I really appreciated that.”

“To be honest, I’m lucky enough that I haven’t had any terrible experiences with my managers. They’re all people that I’ve learned something from. But I would say there was one that was most difficult for me to work with - he was a senior manager at one of my jobs. He was a very business-oriented person. I was coming fresh out of college, and I was just super focused on technology, because that’s what I had always been taught. So to work for this person, I had to make the transition from being - and thinking, and communicating - just like a tech person, into communicating like a business professional. My boss was hard on me about this, and at first my instinct was to push back on it because I didn’t really understand the importance of this kind of language and communication, and it led to some clashes and bad feelings on my end. And while I think he could have better communicated his end goals and reasoning for why he was pushing me, I can retrospectively see that I was also really stubborn. But I’m actually really glad I went through that experience, because as it turns out, he was - of course - totally right. And the ways he pushed me out of my comfort zone ended up paying off. In later jobs I realized how much I would have been shooting myself - and my career - in the foot if I had insisted on just being the “tech guy” and not being able to communicate on a higher level about the business implications of technology.”

**Sample Question: What are your strengths? What are your weaknesses?**

For these commonly-asked questions, make sure that your strengths are related to the job, or to being a valuable member of a team/business. For example, a front end web developer might say, “I have a great eye for design, and I really enjoy the process of creating a user interface that is smooth and delightful to use. For example, in my capstone….” A data scientist might say, “I have a really analytical mind and love finding solutions that are actually backed up by data. For example, in my last job….”

Either one could say something like being a strong communication, or having another quality that is universally appreciated.

Notice how both of those answers ended in examples -- you will always make a bigger impact if you’re able to give a specific example to back up what you’ve said.

For your weaknesses, avoid these answers that are cliche and that recruiters universally hate: “I’m a perfectionist,” “I work too hard,” and “I care too much.”

It’s a good idea to use something that actually is one of your weaknesses, and to show how you have been making progress on this weakness. Avoid mentioning a weakness that is essentially related to the job. For example, if you are applying for a full stack web dev role, and you say your biggest weakness is backend development, you will most likely disqualify yourself for the role. If you want to be a data scientist, and you say your biggest weakness is  that you struggle to communicate clearly with non-technical people, you’ll most likely disqualify yourself. 

When you talk about your weakness, first tell what the weakness is, give a bit of context about how you realized your weakness, and then tell the specific steps you’re taking to get stronger at your weakness. You can end with an update on your progress. For example:

“I would say one of my weaknesses has always been public speaking. I used to have an issue where, as soon as I was talking in front of other people, I would start visibly shaking, and get short of breath. Once I got a job where I regularly had to speak in front of people, I knew I had to face this. So first, I started going to Toastmasters meetings, just to practice talking in a lower-pressure environment. Then I forced myself to sign up to talk at various meetups, to get more and more used to having a random audience. I’m now at the point where I still feel flustered at the start of a talk, but within a few minutes, I can settle down and sound pretty confident. It’s definitely still a work in progress, and something that I’m committed to continuing to work on.”

**Sample Question: Tell me about a time you failed at something.**

This is a great question for using the STAR method. When you’re asked this question, you’re being tested on a couple main things: 1) are you self-aware enough and humble enough to recognize and own your failures?, and 2) do you learn from your failures?

When you’re answering this question, give a bit of context, but get to the failure quickly. Try to avoid failure stories that will need several minutes’ worth of context in order to be understandable. Tell about the failure, the impact of the failure, and - most importantly - what you learned from that failure. Then tell what you’ve done to avoid that same failure in the future.

(See the previous lesson on the STAR method to see an example response.)

When you answer this: Make sure you are actually talking about your own failure - and OWN IT! Some students struggle with this because they tell about a failure that was the result of an organizational problem, or a failure that resulted from someone else’s action. Other people struggle with this question by talking about failures that aren’t actually failures. 

For example, one former student’s response to this was that a research paper she wrote needed some editing before being accepted into the most prestigious journal in her field. It came across as a humble brag, and made her sound like she lacked self-awareness. Another student said that his failure was that he was unable to change the views of his racist boss. It again came across as a lack of self-awareness and inability to take ownership over personal failure. We all fail all the time - so be ready to talk honestly about how these failures have shaped you and helped you learn!

**Sample Question: What 3 words or phrases would your co-workers use to describe you? OR What 3 words or phases would your supervisor use to decribe you? OR What 3 words of phrases would you use to describe your professional self?**

These are all variations on a theme - the difference is the audience. To answer the co-worker question, try to imagine what makes an ideal co-worker. You’re likely going to come up with traits like being a good communicator, being reliable, etc. If you feel those kinds of traits apply to you, come up with specific examples of when you’ve shown those traits. Frame your answer like this:

“I would say my co-workers would call me reliable, a good communicator, and creative. For example, last year, I was on a team of 3 people working on shipping a new product, and we each had really distinct responsibilities, but they were all really dependent on each other for the end result. So if any of us dropped the ball, the whole thing would have failed. I always made sure to deliver each of my piece of the project on time, so we managed to deliver it by the deadlines we had. For being a good communicator - it’s similar. I think it’s really important to make your expectations clear, and to also let people know where you are and when you need help. In my last job, we were relying on each other so much, that I made a point of always communicating so people knew where I was. I ended up setting up a group Trello board so that we could all track each other’s progress, along with our overall progress, towards our project, and if anyone was falling behind we could work together to get back on track. For creative - I was always the person on the team that people would come to if they needed to find a new way to do something. I think I’m good at mentally separating the way something has been done in the past with the ways it could potentially be done. For example, a couple years ago, we had a process for approaching clients that we all knew was inefficient but we were doing it anyways because it had always been done that way. So I wrote up a proposal for a new kind of client relationship that would be higher-impact, and got permission from my boss to do a trial run of pitching our services differently and working with our clients in this more holistic way. It turned out to be a big success, and my company adopted that approach moving forward.”

For the manager question, instead imagine what traits a manager would prioritize when you answer. Some of the traits may be similar, but some may differ - such as being able to take feedback well. 

**Sample Question: Tell me about a time that you had to manage multiple priorities.**

What they are really asking: tell me how - specifically! - you go about managing multiple priorities. Tell your situational story, but don’t forget the details - do you make yourself a to-do list on Asana? Do you use project tracking software like Trello? Do you use the pomodoro technique to power through and make sure you get things done?

**Sample Question: Tell me about a time you worked on a team that didn’t work well together. OR Tell me about a time you didn’t get along with a co-worker.**

STAR time again! Once again, remember that this isn’t the time to air grievances - and also keep in mind that the focus of your story should be how you resolved the conflict.

For example:

“In my last job we were working in this diverse team, with a lot of different nationalities, and because of that there was just this adjustment period of people getting to know each other and understanding how we were all culturally different and had different expectations. Individually, each one of us had our own main project, but we were also contributors on each others’ projects, and we were expected to have a certain level of contribution for each other to help everything move forward. So, I had this one co-worker, and over a few weeks, I started to feel like he just wasn’t putting in as much effort on my project as he was with the other people in the group, and as a result, I was starting to fall a bit behind. It really bothered me, but I didn’t think it was anything malicious. I had managed to establish a pretty good personal rapport with most of my colleagues, so I asked one day after work if I could buy him a drink, and without saying anything accusatory, I let him know how I was feeling, and asked him for his perspective. Turns out, as soon as I mentioned it, he realized that I was right, and admitted that he wasn’t giving it as much attention as he should have - he hadn’t even consciously been aware of it before. He told me that he had never worked with a female colleague in the past, or someone of my nationality, and that he was used to having much more direct instruction from his colleagues about what needed doing. I realized it was partly on me for not directly enough saying what I needed from him, and partly just this communication and cultural awareness failure. After we had that conversation, we managed to work a lot more productively together. He made sure to follow up on his contributions and make sure they were what I needed to move forward, and I made a conscious effort to let him know my expectations and not be overly polite or quiet, which is one of the trademarks of my culture. We both ended up producing great projects with each others’ help.”

**Sample Question: Tell me about your biggest professional challenge.**

When answering this, try to tie it to something you know will be relevant to the job. Though you may have personal challenges that have affected you professionally (such as illness, injury, sexist or racist treatment), tread carefully with these - some interviewers will respond well to your honesty, while others may feel you are trying to gain sympathy with a sob story.

For example:

“When I graduated last year from Berkeley, the first thing I did was accept this internship overseas. I had done a minor in computer science, and I wanted to explore that more - but actually my coding experience at the time was really limited to having built a couple of school assignments in Python and Java. So I went into this company in Denmark, and they had this in-house software platform that was used for communication between departments. It was coded back in the 60s, and at the time it was groundbreaking, but it hadn’t aged well, and my job was going to be bringing it up to speed. I had to really quickly learn Cobra so that I could actually be useful to my team, and get comfortable with the code base super fast so that I could help them ship the new version before my internship ended in 2 months. It was also a really interesting experience taking instructions and understanding the vision from someone whose main language wasn’t English. It was just a lot of challenges rolled into one, with the tech challenges in a language I wasn’t familiar with, to integrating myself in a fully-functional dev team with cultural barriers in a really short amount of time, to overall just learning how to be a great communicator, even when there are language barriers. The fact that we got something off the ground before I left the country is something that I’m really proud of.”

**Sample Question: Tell me about a time you were in a leadership role.**

Hint: though the question asks about a leadership role, what your interviewer really wants to hear is, “Tell me about a time you showed leadership qualities.” Focus your answer around that - meaning, give an example of a specific time that you motivated people to do something - whether or not you had a “manager” job title.

For example:

“I guess the best example would be when I was running my own business for 5 years. It was a food truck - and I had a staff of 8 people working for me. The most challenging times were when we needed to change the business strategy. For example, there was a point where we had tested out different hours because of some local events, and what I realized was that there was a lot more demand for what we were doing as a late-night service, as opposed to an afternoon-early evening thing. This was obviously a big change for my employees; they weren’t used to working those hours, and I needed to get their buy-in to make this change a success. So to do that, I tried to share my vision about how we would be able to capture the market, and I also showed them the data behind the decision. I heard them out - their concerns, and frustrations, and talked with them both as a group and individually about fair compensation that would reflect the change in their duties. We did a week trial run and an afterparty, to try to build their excitement and make them feel like they were really a crucial part of the business - which really, they were!

The biggest thing I learned from the job overall is how important the team is to a business - you’ll literally sink or swim depending on the strength of your people, and how you’re able to keep them on board with the vision of the company. Building a great culture was super important and made us all closer, and made it possible for me to rely on them when we made these kinds of big transitions.”

**Sample Question: Why should we hire you?**

Different candidates have different pros and cons, and employers want to know why your pros would be more advantageous than other candidates’ pros. Come prepared with stories of how you have excelled in other jobs or areas of your life; show the employer that you have a track record of being the best.

The answer to this will be a summary sales pitch of why you are a great fit for the role and the company. Focus on what makes you unique (why do you stand out for this role? There a hundreds of web developers and data scientists looking for jobs!). Refer back to a few key points in the job description and - most importantly - keep it brief.

You answer should ideally outline:

* The technical experience you have that is relevant to the role - including that you have worked on similar projects to what the team is doing, if applicable
* Any industry experience you have that is relevant
* Your understanding of the company’s pain points that you will be able to address
* Your interest in what the company is doing
* That you are a great fit for the company culture
* That you are a fast and dedicated learner, and eager to tackle new challenges

For example:

“You’ve said that you’re looking for someone who can bring technical skills to a niche industry understanding, and I think I do just that. At Galvanize, my capstone project was a churn predictor for a local startup, and so I have experience in one of the main areas you’re hoping your next business analyst is going to be able to address. Though I don’t know Scala yet, I’m super excited to learn it - and I’ve proven in the past that I’m able to quickly get up to speed in programming languages. Prior to Galvanize, my five years’ experience in supply chain operations for a bakery has given me a deep understanding of the exact kinds of challenges you’re facing as a food startup. Finally, I really believe in what you’re doing - I really believe that Imperfect Produce is going to solve the food desert problem we have right now. I grew up in an area with no grocery store and never had fresh produce, and I really appreciate how you’re making that accessible at low prices to a wide market.”
