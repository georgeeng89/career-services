# Resources for Technical Interview Prep

## Lesson Objective: 
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to 
 - Find resources for their interview prep.

## Rationale: 
Interviews are difficult - and often test slightly different skills than the ones that are actually used on the job. Prepare for them using these resources.

### Understanding the basic technical interview format

Read [Ian Douglas’s Technical Interview Prep Email Series](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pU4K37w3rKJjCTZ7xB3Z4HweBAhMWFKd_NFyq7g1F-4/edit?usp=sharing) to see examples of questions asked at different stages. Most useful for web dev, but also valuable insights for data science on some of the CS questions (data structures, algorithms) and how to talk about projects.

### Online coding practice - multiple languages - and interview prep resources

These are great places to practice your coding for technical screens - for both data science and web dev.

### Coding interview prep books

* [Algorithm Design Manual](https://www.amazon.com/Algorithm-Design-Manual-Steven-Skiena/dp/1848000693/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1462241467&sr=8-1&keywords=algorithm+design+manual+skiena&tag=charity48-20)
* [Cracking the Coding Interview](https://inspirit.net.in/books/placements/Cracking%20the%20Coding%20Interview.pdf)
  * How to use:
    * Spend no more than 20 - 30 minutes with no progress. 
    * At that point, look up the solution, and try to understand it.
    * Re-work the problem again.
    * Try it again after 2 days.

### Haseeb Qureshi’s Interview Prep Suggestions

* [Princeton Algorithms Course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1) - up until Dijkstra’s Algorithm
* [Software Engineering Daily Podcast](https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/category/podcast/)
* [The Bike Shed](http://bikeshed.fm/)
* [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/)
* [System Design Questions](https://www.hiredintech.com/system-design)
* [High Scalability](http://highscalability.com/all-time-favorites/)
* [System Design Interview](https://github.com/checkcheckzz/system-design-interview)
* Study the following algorithms:
  * Linked List
  * Dynamic array, implemented with a ring buffer (use a statically sized array underneath the hood)
  * Hash set
  * Hash map (with chaining)
  * Binary heap (without decrease-key; know that Fibonacci heaps exist and know their guarantees)
  * Binary search tree (doesn't need to be self-balancing; know that self-balancing trees exist and know their guarantees)
  * Prefix tree (a.k.a. trie)
  * Suffix tree (don't worry about compression, just build a dumb version; know thatUkkonen's algorithm exists and learn its guarantees)
  * An object-oriented adjacency list for graphs
