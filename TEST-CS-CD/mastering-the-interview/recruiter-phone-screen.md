# Mastering the Recruiter Screen

## Objectives: 
By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
 - Explain the typical interview process in either data science or web development
 - Tell how to prepare for the recruiter phone screen

## Rationale:

The start of the formal interview process will usually be a phone call with a recruiter. It's important to understand how to get over this preliminary hurdle to give yourself as many options as possible.

### Review of the Typical Interview Process

In Unit 8, you read about the typical interview processes in both data science and web development. In this Unit, we will be going into each part of the process in more detail, as well as talking about how to master each step of the process.

For a quick review, let's look at the different stages of the interview process:

In data science…

* The first round is usually a **20 - 30 minute phone screen with a recruiter or hiring manager,** depending on the size of the company. This will usually cover: 1) “Tell me about yourself” - be ready to deliver your pitch, tailored to the company and role! 2) Why you got into data science and how your previous experience led you here. 3) What skills you have that are relevant. 4) “Tell me about your project” - be ready to talk about your case studies and capstone. 5) Why this company and role? 6) Some soft skills questions. 7) Opportunity to learn more about the company, role, and interview process.

* The next round often consists of a **Take Home Challenge.** These vary in length by company - sometimes you are expected to take your time and spend about a week on the assignment; other times, you will be given a strict time deadline (like 4 hours). 

* The third round often is a **Technical Phone Screen.** This will usually be with a hiring manager, who is a data scientist or software engineer, and will typically last between 30 minutes and an hour. This most commonly consists of a live coding challenge, while explaining your thought process to the hiring manager.

* The final round is an **Onsite Interview,** which will vary a lot from company to company. Sometimes and onsite interview is as short as 2 hours, and other times, they will last all day (9 am  - 5 pm). You should expect to meet your hiring manager and some future teammates, as well as a sampling of other people in the company (if a smaller company, it’s not uncommon to meet the CEO or similarly senior person). The onsite is typically a mix of soft skills questions, talk about the company and role, pair programming challenges, whiteboarding challenges, and questions that test your general technical knowledge.

In web development…

* The first round is usually a **20 - 30 minute  phone screen with a recruiter or hiring manager,** depending on the size of the company. This will usually cover: 1) “Tell me about yourself” - be ready to deliver your pitch, tailored to the company and role! 2) Why you got into web development and how your previous experience led you here. 3) What skills you have that are relevant (remember to talk about the computer science curriculum!). 4) “Tell me about your project” - be ready to talk about your projects and capstone. 5) Why this company and role? 6) Some soft skills questions. 7) Opportunity to learn more about the company, role, and interview process.

* Frequently, the next round will be an **Online Coding Challenge.** These vary in length. To practice for these, look at the challenges on web sites like HackerRank (https://www.hackerrank.com/) and CodeFights (https://codefights.com/). According to one of HackerRank’s own studies, programmers who complete at least 20 coding challenges on their site for practice end up performing about twice as well in interview coding challenges. 

* Rarely, a company will also give a **Take Home Challenge.** This will be a more project-based, in-depth coding challenge - occasionally as involved as building out an app.

* The next round often is a **Technical Phone Screen.** This will usually be with a hiring manager, or a software engineer, and will typically last between 30 minutes and an hour. This most commonly consists of a live coding challenge, while explaining your thought process to the hiring manager.

* The final round is an **Onsite Interview,** which will vary a lot from company to company. Sometimes and onsite interview is as short as 2 hours, and other times, they will last all day (9 am  - 5 pm). You should expect to meet your hiring manager and some future teammates, as well as a sampling of other people in the company (if a smaller company, it’s not uncommon to meet the CEO or similarly senior person). The onsite is typically a mix of soft skills questions, talk about the company and role, pair programming challenges, whiteboarding challenges, and questions that test your general technical knowledge.

The typical interview process takes 4 - 6 weeks from first contact. Small startups tend to have the fastest interview processes, and can sometimes go from initial contact to offer in 1 - 2 weeks. Large companies tend to have the slowest interview processes, and the most flexibility in their interviewing timelines. 

### The Recruiter Phone Screen

The recruiter screen will be the first step in the interview process at most companies. Companies have recruiters to make these calls to save them time and money - it has been shown that a recruiter can usually tell if a candidate will be a good fit for a company within the first 15 minutes of talking to them (based on personality, work experience, and how you talk about your technical experience). If you pass the recruiter screen, you will usually get the chance to take some technical tests to show that you are also a great technical fit for the role at hand.

Read through the following sections about how to prepare for a phone screen.

### The Basics

Find a spot that is quiet and has good phone reception.

* Have your laptop with you. You will want to use it to look at pre-written notes, your resume, and take notes on the things the recruiter tells you.

* Leave extra time. Most recruiter screens will last 20 - 30 minutes; however, sometimes they go over (and this can be a really good sign!). Make sure you have given yourself some buffer time, especially if you are in a situation such as having booked a room at Galvanize - you don’t want to get kicked out by the next meeting starting.

* Have your resume in front of you. You may be asked to talk the recruiter through your resume, or to answer specific questions about something you have written. It’s useful to have it right in front of you to jog your memory.

* Pay attention to how - and when - you talk. Interviews make most people nervous, which can affect how you talk. Though you want to hit all your main points, make sure you do not babble and be sure to leave pauses for followup questions. On the other end of the spectrum, you may feel the need to stop and think about an answer to a question - and that’s ok! Instead of just leaving a gap of silence, tell the interviewer, “That’s a good question! Can I think on that for a moment?” 

### Body Language During the Phone Screen

While it may seem counterintuitive, body language is actually quite important for the phone screen!

* **Make sure your voice is warmed up.** If you are taking a phone call and it is the first time all day that you’ve talked to someone, your interviewer will be able to hear it. Have a conversation with someone else ahead of time, or if you’re alone, have a conversation with yourself!

* **Remember to Breathe.** In your eagerness to express yourself, it can be easy to fit in too many words and run out of breath. 

* **Get Dressed.** Even though nobody will be seeing you, you may actually perform better if you are fully dressed. Many people find that this helps them be more mentally alert and take the interview as seriously as an in-person interview. 

* **Stand Up.** Similarly, by standing, you will often sound more energized. 

* **If you have nerves, Exercise Beforehand.** If you have a lot of built up nerves and stress before the interview, try doing some exercise. It will help you physically release some of the stress and can help calm you down before the interview.


### Be Prepared

* **Tailor Your Story to the Role/Company.** One of the first things you will probably be asked is, “Tell me about yourself!” You’ve already spent some time crafting your stories - be prepared in this version to tailor the end of your story towards the company and role. You’ll learn more about how to do this in the next lesson on Soft Skills Interviewing. Keep an outline of how your story relates to the company either on your laptop or on a piece of paper that you can have in front of you. Avoid writing it out word-for-word - that may tempt you to read it word-for-word, which will sound overly-rehearsed. 

* **Have Talking Points.** From what you know about the company and the job description, make a list of things that you know you want to talk about during the interview. This will likely include your relevant skill sets - and how you have actually used them in projects and case studies. You may also have particularly relevant experience or interests that you want to highlight. Actually write these things down, either on your computer or a piece of paper that you can have in front of you, so that you don’t forget them. Your talking points should include:
  * Your story and how it relates to the job/company
  * Your relevant skill sets
  * Your projects you’ve worked on - in detail
  * Any other information about you that shows you are interested in the company/job
  * Notes on the company’s culture and specific ways that it resonates with you
  * Answers to common soft skills questions and your stories that relate to them (see the next lesson for more on this!)
  * **Why this particular company is of interest to you - be specific!**

* **Be Ready to Ask Questions.** Take notes on everything you learn - you’ll use this for future interviews. You should ask questions about:
  * The position. What are the biggest technical challenges that the team is working on? For data science, what kinds of data problems are they working with? For web dev, what projects in the team working on?
  * What kind of person is the hiring manager looking for on his/her team?
  * What kinds of problems has the team been facing?
  * What skill sets are most important for this role?
  * What is the structure of the team?
  * What opportunities for growth are there for a role like this?
  * How is the company planning to grow in the next year? Next 5 years?
  * What kind of people does the company look to hire? What does the company value most in the company culture?
  * Why did the recruiter decide to join the company? What’s been the most surprising thing since joining? What does he/she like about it most?

### Get Technical

* **Don’t Be Too High-Level**. A big mistake that we tend to see people make is that they don’t go into enough technical detail on their projects with their recruiters. While many recruiters themselves are not data scientists or web developers, good technical recruiters know enough about these areas that they know what they are looking for. If you only give a very high-level, non-technical description of your work, the recruiter is likely to think that you don’t know what you’re talking about. When you talk about your projects, you should:
  * Give a high-level, plain-English overview of what your project was. What did you set out to achieve? How long did you spend on the project?
  * Now get more technical: how did you actually do it? What were the first steps (such as cleaning the data)? What technologies did you use? Why did you use a specific technology for a specific part of the project? Why did you use certain machine learning techniques? Did you have to learn anything new for the project?
  * What challenges did you run up against? How did you resolve them?
  * What was the end result? In data science especially, recruiters will like to hear about how you got insights out of your data - and this is something people often forget to talk about. 
  * If you had another two weeks - or a month - to work on the project, what would you do next?

**Things to Always Avoid.**
At this stage, it’s best to not talk about:
* **Salary and benefits.** To put yourself in the best position to negotiate later on, you should avoid answering this question. (NOTE: As of 2018, in California, employers will no longer be allowed to ask you what your salary history is, and they will be required to provide a salary range for the role if you ask for one. However, they CAN still ask you what salary you want.) If you’re asked about this, deflect, or turn the question back on the recruiter: “I’m really focused right now on finding something that is a great fit, both where I’m going to be able to make a big impact and help grow a company, and where I’m going to be able to learn a lot. Let’s revisit salary later once we both know that this is a great match.” “I’d actually like to learn more about the role and get a better understanding about the full scope of it before we talk specific numbers. Salary is just one part of the overall package for me, and I need to know more before I can make an informed decision.” “I’d love to know how Postmates thinks about compensation! What does salary and the compensation package typically look like for you guys for a role like this?”
* **What the company can do for you.** You obviously hope your career will be helped by this role, and that you will learn new things. But at this stage, always focus on what you will be able to do for the company.

**Things to Always Ask.** 
You should always ask the following questions:
* What is the timeline for this role - when do they want to make a hire? When do they want the person to start working?
* What is the interview process? What is the next step? Who else will you be talking to?
* When should you expect to hear about next steps? (This is important to ask because it gives you permission to follow up after a certain date!)
* Are there any other questions the recruiter has for you, or is there any other information that you can get across to them? Are there any concerns you can address, that could prevent you from moving forward?

### Follow Up Afterwards

After the interview, make sure you quickly send a follow-up email. This should thank the recruiter for his/her time, mention something specific that you talked about in the interview, re-iterate your interest in the role, and say that you are looking forward to hearing about the next steps. Include any information that was requested during the interview, and if you didn’t answer something well, clarify it now. For example:

Hi Amanda,

Thank you for taking the time to talk with me earlier. I really enjoyed hearing about your experience since joining - the company culture as you have described it sounds just like the kind of company I’m looking for! I’m also excited about the data challenges the team is working on right now, and I’m looking forward to getting to go into those in more detail with Mark.

To clarify what I said earlier about my timeline - I am in process with a few other companies at the moment, but Instacart is definitely one of the opportunities that excites me the most. I am hoping to make a decision in the next 4 - 6 weeks. Does that timeline work for the role you’re looking to fill?

Thanks again, and I’m looking forward to hearing from you on next steps!
