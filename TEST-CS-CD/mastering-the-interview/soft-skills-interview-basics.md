# Soft Skills Interview Basics

## Objectives: 
By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
 - Explain how to tailor their story to a specific company
 - Answer common soft-skills questions using the STAR technique
 - Explain why an interview should be like a conversation

## Rationale:

Interviews are subjective, based off of who’s interviewing you. When you prepare for soft-skill questions, understand the value that you can bring to a company as well as your goals and interests. You will deliver better answers and be more confident, which interviewers interpret as competence. 

Interviewers can - and will - ask a number of questions based on their own interests and intention. So while we can’t prepare for every possible question, the STAR method is a framework that allows us to answer any question with confidence and structure:

S – Situation, background set the scene 
<br>
T – Task or Target, specifics of what's required, when, where, who 
<br>
A – Action, what you did, skills used, behaviours, characteristics 
<br>
R – Result – Outcome, what happened?

<br>

Interviews are like first dates; they’re an opportunity for both parties to learn more about the other and determine if they’re a good match. For this reason, you should also come prepared to ask the interviewer questions. 

### Talking about yourself

You’ve already worked on talking about yourself and building a general story that you can use when meeting people, such as in networking situations. Now, we are going to talk about how to tailor that to a specific job and company.

When you answer the “Tell me about yourself” question in an interview setting, you can go into a little more detail and take more time than you would in a networking situation. After all, this isn’t casual socializing - your interviewer specifically wants to learn more about you!

Make sure that you practice the interview version of your story so that it comes out naturally, and doesn’t sound overly-rehearsed. Also, watch your timing as you say your story out loud - many students end up rushing through their stories because they are trying to fit too much into a short period of time.

For your interview story, make sure you hit the following points:

* Anchor (not name! They already know it!)
* Background - and you can now go into a bit more detail, including any big accomplishments
* Motivation
* Galvanize - including that you have worked on projects, and your skill sets
* What you would like to do with your skills
* Why you have come to this company in particular

This formula will be a great way to touch, on a high-level, all the most important things a company needs to know about you, tells your basic qualifications for the job at hand, gives good points for your interviewer to ask follow-up questions (such as the second-most-common question you’ll get: “Tell me about your project!”), and shows that you are here interviewing because you want this company and this job - not just that you are desperate for any job.

Here are two versions of a story. What impact do the additions in the second story have?

**Version 1**

“Hi! I’m Mary Ann. I’m a career coach at Galvanize with a background in recruitment. When I was a recruiter, I was bothered by how many industries claimed to be meritocracies when they were not at all, so I started working on finding ways to increase opportunities for people who weren’t getting them. Along the way, I started my own business, and then worked at an early-stage YC startup that shared my interests. At Galvanize, I’m working with web development and data science students from diverse backgrounds, and am helping them use their new skill sets to land their first jobs in tech.”

**Version 2**

“I’m a career coach with a background in recruitment. I got my start in recruitment - as most recruiters do - mostly accidentally, but once I was doing it, I learned that I loved working with people and helping them build their careers. I also really enjoyed the business development aspect of the job, and quickly built up a client base throughout London of the top PR agencies. Within a month of starting recruiting, I was the top biller in my agency. Soon, though, I started noticing something that bothered me: all of my clients told me that the industry was a meritocracy, but I was seeing that it wasn’t, at all. The opportunities kept going to the same kind of people with the same kind of background, and having the wrong name or wrong degree would automatically disqualify people from jobs.

So I decided to start my own agency that would have a specific focus on having a very consultative approach for my clients - helping them strategically grown their teams and bring them hard-to-find candidates - while also making a point of extending opportunities to candidates who were being overlooked in the hiring process. I pitched to investors for start-up funding, and I built up a client base of companies not only in London, but throughout the UK, Europe, the Middle East, East Asia, and Australia. I’m really proud of the work I did, and the diverse candidates I was able to bring to the table for my clients.

After returning to San Francisco due to visa reasons, I decided to get involved in tech, because I was seeing a lot of the same issues. People kept claiming that the industry was a meritocracy, when in reality it wasn’t. So, I joined an early-stage Y-Combinator company as the 3rd employee. We were working on making a more fair engineer hiring process - something that was really based on skills instead of on resumes. I helped adjust our algorithms so that we could match our candidates to companies based on their interests, risk tolerance, and passions, instead of just technical skills. I also managed both the client side of the business, making sure that our partner companies were getting the right talent, and the full cycle hiring process for every candidate. I managed to raise our average monthly placements from 2.5 per month to 6.5.

Now, I’m excited to bring my experience and skills to Galvanize. I love that students can come here as long as they have the drive and determination to succeed, and I think they are exactly the kind of people who will be changing the face of tech. On my end, I think I can add a lot of value because I’ve spent the past 7 years not only coaching people through the entire job hunt process, but also working with companies and helping them understand the value of hiring more diverse teams.”

### The STAR Technique for Answering Questions

Non-technical interview questions are often categorized as behavioral: questions that are based on your past experiences and behavior in a given situation. For example, Describe a time when you disagreed with your direct manager. Employers ask these types of questions in an effort to predict how you might behave in the future. 

The STAR Method offers a framework for answering any behavioral question thrown at you. Simply define a past Situation that you were in or Task that you needed to accomplish, then the Action that you took to address that situation or task, and, finally, the Result of your actions. 


|Situation or 
Task|Describe the situation that you were in or the task that you needed to accomplish. Be specific, providing a real, relevant example from a past job or school project, a personal project, or volunteer experience.|
|Action|What spection action(s) did you take?|
|Result|What was the result? What did you accomplish or  learn?|

One perk of behavioral questions is that they’re open-ended, which means that, when using the STAR Method, you can choose any situation or task from your past. Of course, it’s logical to only choose situations that shine a positive light on you. 

[Behavior interview questions often relate to how you interact on a team, your ability to lead or be led by others, how you handle conflict, your ability to problem solve, and how you respond when you fail.](https://biginterview.com/blog/behavioral-interview-questions) When preparing for an interview, think of (perhaps, write down) how you can apply the STAR Method to each of these common types of behavioral questions.

Let’s look at an example of the STAR method in action - one that was given by a former student! Can you find the STAR components?

**Question:** Tell me about a time you failed.

**Answer:** Ha, I fail a lot! But really, at my last job there was a time I failed, and learned a lot from it. I was young and inexperienced, and it was also a young company, so there weren’t a lot of procedures in place for me to follow. I was the product manager for this early product and dashboard that we were building out. I wanted to prove myself, and so I put a lot of energy around leading these 2-week sprints to develop the product. I got everyone really excited about my vision for the product, but I made a critical mistake: I never stopped to validate it - any version of it - with actual customers. So we released the product, and it flopped - a total failure. 

Fortunately, I learned a lot from that experience. I learned that analytics and customer validation should be the groundwork of any product that we were building. I went back to the project and looked at it step by step - I wanted to understand, what warning signs had there been? What signals were there? When we started work on the dashboard’s replacement product, I put that mentality into place and we tested it throughout, resulting in a product that was received much better.

This is actually what first spurred me to get more involved in data science - I wanted to be able to use data to make intelligent decisions about how to build great products. That’s one of the reasons why I’m so excited about this position, which I think would allow me to do that.
