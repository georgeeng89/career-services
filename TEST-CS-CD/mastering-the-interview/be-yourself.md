# Rethinking the interview: How to show up, be yourself, and have nothing to lose

## Lesson Objectives:
By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
 - Debunk common assumptions about power dynamics in interviews
 - Assess unconscious assumptions you may have about interviews, and understand how they impact your interview performance. 
 - Understand how authenticity shapes interview outcomes. 

## Rationale:
If mindset drives behavior, which drives results - the mindset or assumptions you have coming into an interview will drive your interview performance. There are several common interview mindset pitfalls candidates run into. This lesson calls attention to these pitfalls, and offers an alternative perspective and approach when interviewing. 

### What comes to mind when you think about interviews?
For many people, interviews are a high stakes, high pressure situation in which the interviewer/ employer holds the reins of the entire conversation while the candidate is taken for a ride. Most people see an interview as a test - a series of questions in which there are “right” and “wrong” answers - as though your experiences could be chalked up to a True/ False exam! However, many of these assumptions are the origin of interview anxiety, and can block successful interview behaviors from emerging. 

When you think of interviewing, what comes to mind?

The reality is, an interview is simply an opportunity for both the employer and the candidate to learn more about one another in an effort to determine fit. It’s really that simple! The outcome of the conversation is not a reflection of your worthiness to work, and isn’t to be taken personally. The goal of every interview is always to determine fit in a variety of areas (role, company, team, product, etc). Remember - fit goes both ways. Interviews are an opportunity for you to determine if they are a fit for you, just as much as they are trying to determine if you are a fit for them. It’s a two way street!

While it may seem counterintuitive - a candidate’s goal for an interview is not to “get the job”. The reality is, especially in first interviews, you don’t have enough information to determine if a role is the right fit for you. Instead, as a candidate, your interview goal is to gather information, while sharing compelling information about you which builds your brand.

### Common pitfall assumptions, and how to rethink them
Below is a list of common assumptions made about interviews, alongside an alternative way to think about that assumption. 

Pitfall Assumption
Alternative Thought
The interviewer holds all the power in the interview.
We are both looking for the right fit, and thus both have power in this conversation.
I have to embellish my accomplishments to impress them.
I have to communicate my accomplishments in a way they understand/ is meaningful to them.
There is a “right” answer to their interview questions. 
Interview questions aren’t a true/ false test. There isn’t a “right” answer, only the truth as I see it. 
Being “professional” in an interview means only sticking to the questions asked. 
They want to get to know me, because I may be working with them for 40+ hours/ week. It’s okay to add context and color to who I am.

### Why is it important to be authentic in an interview?
As discussed in previous lessons about mindset, your mindset drives behaviors, which drive outcomes. The same can be said for interviewing. Coming into an interview relaxed and focused allows for an interviewer to better understand your value as they ask you different interview questions. Set the intention that you are going to both be your authentic self, and answer all questions as best as possible. 

Interviewers are trained to sniff out someone phoney in a heartbeat. Candidates who come across fake, defensive, or inaccessible are assumed to be lying, challenging to work it, or hard to communicate with. Imagine if that was someone’s first impression of you! 

Moreover, interviews can already feel like high pressure, win or lose situations in which candidates put a lot of pressure on themselves to “perform”. However, an interview isn’t a performance. Rather, it is an assessment of mutual fit; fit for you within their team/ company, and fit for their role for you. You have the right to interview them just as much as they are interviewing you!

### What does authenticity look like in an interview? 
* **Walking in with an open mind, ready to learn, and open to opportunity:** There is much to be discovered in an interview. These conversations are the right time to be curious about the company, role, your future teammates, etc. Remember, this is a conversation, not a test. 
* **Answering honestly, and being transparent:** In an interview, your future teammates are learning to trust you. Being honest and transparent sets the foundation for a strong working relationship, and ensures there aren’t any surprises later down the road related to your abilities. 
* **Being confident and relaxed in who you are, and what you have to offer:** Getting clear about what you have to offer and the value you can add is part of building your brand. If you’ve done your research, it will be easier to articulate how you fit at that company. 

### What it does not mean
* **Oversharing, or offering TMI:** Being authentic doesn’t mean “letting it all hang out.” Getting too personal and off topic too soon will create doubt about your professionalism early in the “getting to know you” process. 
* **Rambling without focus:** You have 30 seconds to make your point before your listeners check out. Ensure your responses are targeted, meaningful, and direct (while still being warm). 
* **Not preparing due to overconfidence:** If you think you’re a shoe in, check your ego at the door. The last thing you want is to come across as arrogantly underprepared. 
* **Selling yourself short/ failing to highlight your strengths:** Telling the truth doesn’t mean chronically underselling yourself. If asked about a required skill you haven’t yet learned, rather than state “I don’t know that”, say “here’s my plan to learn this before I start.”
