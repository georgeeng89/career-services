### What you know about them
1. A well-researched candidate is an outstanding candidate. Going above and beyond with your interview preparation and research is a reflection of how you will go above and beyond in a role. Stop to consider: What do they do; What are their products; Who is on their executive team; Were they in the news recently; What’s the company’s size; Do ample research to identify 7-10 talking points about this company. Here’s how:
1. Check for big news about the company. First, Google “company name news” and skim the first few articles. Determine if any of these articles describe the company’s technology and/or data strategy. Think through now newsworthy items might affect your future team, if it’s not explicitly mentioned. Draft 2 questions for your interviewers based on this information.
1. Dig into the product. Spend 30 minutes using the product as if you were part of the target demographic. Think about the implications of the product on your future role. 
1. Check open source information to give you information about what they’re currently working on. For web developers, check our their repos in github. For data scientists, check Kaggle Data Science Use Cases. In most cases, interviewers will ask questions about problems they’re currently working on. The problems are top-of-mind for them, and they’re looking to see how quickly and at what depth you can answer the questions as compared to other interviewees and even themselves.
1. Figure out the tech stack. Interviewers usually ask questions using their own stack and techniques. The best sources for this information are job descriptions at the company - not just the one you’re applying for, but others on the team as well.
1. Understand each of your interviewers. The best sources of information about your interviewers are likely to be Linkedin, YouTube, Twitter, and possibly a blog. Use whatever you can find to draft 2 questions for each interviewer. Pay special attention to opportunities to glean hints about your interviewer’s hobbies or interests, so that you know to mention similar during the interview if the opportunity arises.
1. Search “<Company Name> Software Development (or) Data Science” Run this query on Google, YouTube, and Twitter and see what kind of content you can find. If nothing, find content from a competitor — they’re likely using the same or similar tools and techniques.
1. Scour Glassdoor, Quora for insider info. Sometimes you can find really specific and useful information about an interview process on these sites. Use with caution - you should always let an interviewer know if you’ve seen a particular question at a previous time.

### Highlighting your brand: What they should know about you
Now that you have researched this company and role, determine why you are an outstanding candidate for this role. Be ready with talking points which reiterate your fit throughout the interview. Consider the following: What is my professional brand? How does my brand align with their brand? What experiences have prepared me for this role? Why am I the best candidate for this role, with this company? Use your research to articulate why you are a unique fit for their unique culture.

### Ways to Impress: Going above and beyond to stand out
There are many things you can do to help you stand out from other candidates. Here are a few tips and ideas of ways you can get a leg up over your competition. 
**Come prepared with planned projects:** Review their technology stacks, and identify tools you haven’t used before. Before the interview, create a plan for how you intend to learn these new skills prior to your start. You can also offer to share a take-home assignment when you weren’t given one. This will help mitigate their concerns around lacking experience with their specific tools and stacks. 

**Follow up with each interviewer with a reference to the interview:** Take note of interesting parts of your interview, and use this information to craft a thoughtful thank you email. For example, imagine the interviewer discusses their future plans to restructure their microservices architecture. In your follow up, you may mention these plans, and express your excitement for the opportunity to contribute to this restructuring. 

**Share helpful information:** Based on your conversation, share helpful resources and information they may find beneficial. Whether it’s a book, podcast, white paper, or technical library, you can demonstrate your expertise and establish yourself as a professional in your field by sharing relevant information and resources they may not have been aware from before.
