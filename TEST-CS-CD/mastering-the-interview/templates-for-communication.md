# Templates for Communication

## Objectives: 
By the end of this lesson, students should understand how to format different messages while on the job hunt. 

## Rationale: 
Always remember that you run your job search - and if you wait for the company to contact you on their schedule, you will likely lose out on opportunities. You can use these templates to follow up with various people and manage different aspects of your search.

### Replying to an intro email

NOTE: Always reply immediately when someone has made an intro email for you - do NOT wait for the other person to follow up first! Keep the person who introduced you on the first email as a BCC so they know that you have followed up with the intro they made. 

Hi Mary Ann,

Thanks very much for the introduction! (Moving to BCC.)

Julie, as Mary Ann mentioned, I’m very interested in learning more about roles at Google, and am particularly interested in the work being done in (x). 

Would you be available to chat Wednesday or Thursday afternoon?

Speak soon,

George

Hi Mary Ann,

I wanted to thank you again for introducing me to Julie at Google. Unfortunately, after our chat yesterday, it seems like I’m not a good fit for what they are after right now. However, I really enjoyed getting to learn more about (X) and we will be keeping in touch about future opportunities!

I’ll keep you posted.

Speak soon,

### Cold emailing a person about setting up a meeting

Dear XX,

My name is XX, and I’m a XX currently working with XX while I complete the XX course at Galvanize. I’m reaching out because (why is this person interesting?). I’d love to learn about (something specific that this person has done).

I’m sure you’re busy, so I’d appreciate any time you have for a quick phone call (or I’d be more than happy to buy you coffee!). 

Thanks so much,
XX

**For example:**

Hi Alice,

My name is Mary Ann, and I’m a career coach currently working with students at Galvanize and helping them break into the tech industry. I’m reaching out because I am really interested in learning about new strategies for increasing diversity in tech, and I saw your recent blog post about diversity initiatives you are currently undertaking at Slack. I’d love to learn about how you implemented blind tech screens as part of your interview process and the challenges you’ve had with that.

I’m sure you’re busy, so I’d appreciate any time you have for a quick phone call (or I’d be more than happy to buy you coffee!).
 
Thanks so much,
Mary Ann



### Cold messaging on Linkedin

Hi! I really love DoorDash! I noticed you work on diversity over there, and we both have backgrounds in tech. I'd love to pick your brain about how you made the transition from tech to what you do now. Are you free for a coffee or quick phone call? It would mean a lot to me! Thanks - MaryAnn

### Following up with interviewer after an interview

Hi Jimmy,

Thanks again for taking the time to chat with me today! I really enjoyed learning more about how Lob is using machine learning to improve shipping.
