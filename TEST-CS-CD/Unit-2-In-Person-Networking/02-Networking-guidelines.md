### Networking Guidelines

If the idea of just going out and meeting people seems intimidating and too unstructured, never fear! Here are some basic in-person networking guidelines that will allow you to make the most of a networking opportunity.

<br>
**Do your homework ahead of time.**

If you are going to an industry event like a conference or a meetup, it can be valuable to spend some time researching ahead of time. Try to understand the context of the event. What are the hot topics being discussed in that industry? What are the technologies being used? What challenges are being faced at the moment?

This kind of research can help you feel less lost, and can give you conversation talking points.

Additionally, if you know who will be at the event, make sure you also research them! For example, speakers at events are often advertised in advance. In case you get the opportunity to connect with them, make sure you know a little about their backgrounds and areas of expertise, so you can ask a few intelligent questions that will make you more memorable.

<br>
**Starting the Conversation**

The best and simplest way to start a conversation is with your Basic Introduction that you practiced in Unit 1. Approach someone with a smile, confident posture, and firm handshake, and say your version: “Hi, my name is Mary Ann, I’m a career coach and I help people break into careers in the tech industry.” Follow this up quickly with a question: “What do you do?”

Asking a question is a great way to get a conversation started. If the person you are talking to gives you the equivalent of a basic introduction in return, use it as a hook to ask a follow up: “That sounds interesting! Tell me more about yourself/about that!”

If you’re in a situation where the Basic Introduction just won’t do, here are some other ideas to start a conversation, from Minda Zetlin’s excellent article on the topic (https://www.inc.com/minda-zetlin/10-foolproof-ways-to-start-a-conversation-with-absolutely-anyone.html):

* Mention something pleasant at the event (great food, good music, etc.)
* Comment on the weather - can be positive or negative
* Ask for information (“Do you know what time the speech starts?”)
* Ask for assistance (“Excuse me - could you help me reach that?”)
* Offer assistance (“Do you need help carrying that?”)
* Ask for an opinion (“What did you think about that breakout session?”)
* Mention a mutual acquaintance (“I saw you work at HubSpot - do you know Julie Kline?”)
* Bring up a shared experience (“I saw we both went to Notre Dame!”)
* Praise the listener (“I loved reading the LinkedIn post you recently wrote.”)
* Compliment their apparel or accessories (but NOT their physical appearance. “I love your glasses!”)

<br>
**It’s not all about you - LISTEN**

<img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4058/4255321476_93d737a959_b.jpg" width="500">

While you want to get a chance to share your story, it’s important that you don’t dominate the conversation - there is also a lot you can learn by listening to other people.

Even more importantly, you can more quickly build relationships when you are a good listener. You will pick up on more important details in the conversation, and be able to ask deeper and more intelligent follow-up question, if you listen attentively.

Finally, people feel good when they talk about themselves. If you give someone the opportunity to tell their story, and are an attentive listener, they will likely walk away with a positive impression of the conversation and you.

<br>
**Ask good questions**

This follows along from the previous guideline. The more actively you listen, the better you will be able to ask meaningful follow-up questions.

Aim to ask questions that are open-ended (require a full-sentence answer), as opposed to closed-ended questions, which just require a “yes” or “no” answer. This will help keep the conversation flowing.

Also, try to ask questions that will keep the attention on the speaker so you can learn more about their story, instead of redirecting the attention to yourself or asking for a favor. 

(For example, aim for, “Tell me more about your journey into data science,” as opposed to, “How can I get a job like yours?” or “Will you refer me for a role at your company?”)

<br>
**Pay Attention to Details**

And take note of them! After you leave the conversation, immediately write down everything you can remember about your conversation into your notes app on your phone or some other safe place - from what they do at work, to where they like to go skiing in Tahoe, to what kind of dog they have.

This information will be very useful later for following up and helping this person to remember you and your conversation, out of potentially dozens that they have had in a night.

Another important detail to collect - **contact information.** Aim to walk away from the conversation with a LinkedIn request or email address (phone numbers are touchy for some people - you don’t want them to feel like you are hitting on them!).

It can be useful to keep the LinkedIn app open on your phone when you are networking. As the conversation is coming to a close, say, “I’d love to stay in touch. Can we connect on LinkedIn?” Then have the person type in his/her name as you are standing there so that you can connect right away, and not have to worry about misspelling their name later.

**Think about how you can add value**

Britt Morgan-Saks, head of artist services at Spotify, places a large emphasis on adding value for other people she meets while networking: 

“A truly connected person cares about bringing value to those around them. I have strong relationships and a network of people who trust me and will go out on a limb for me … as I would for them. Perhaps it sounds a bit sentimental and a tad trite, but I truly have a passion for seeing good, talented people win. My immediate reaction to meeting a brilliant, creative, inspiring person is always, ‘how can I help this person accomplish his or her goal? Who do I know that this person must meet?’”

Many jobseekers come across as needy in a networking situation, which can be a turn-off for more established professionals. Avoid this by always placing an emphasis on adding value for every person you meet. You can add value on a professional level - such as by offering to check out an app they’re working on - or on a personal level - such as giving a great winery recommendation when you learn they are heading up to Napa at the weekend.

Aim to start your relationships by offering something instead of asking for something. And, start networking early into your time at Galvanize, so that you can continue to add value for people you meet, long before you get on the job market and start asking for favors, like referrals for jobs.

If you’re not sure what you can do for someone, it’s always ok to ask directly, **“What can I do to help you out?”** Most people will be a little taken aback by this question because they get asked it so rarely - and this will definitely make you stand out, in a positive way! Even if they cannot think of anything on the spot, they will remember your offer to help, and may get back to you later.

Always take notes of ways that you can add value for someone in the same app where you add your networking notes (and later transfer your notes to your Career Development Tracker). This will help ensure that you follow up on any promises that you’ve made.

Here are some easy examples for how you can add value for someone:

* A link to a recent article related to their industry or to your conversation
* An offer of introduction to someone in your network
* An invitation to a Galvanize community event

<br>
**Ending the Conversation**

Closing a conversation might seem as difficult as initiating one, but just as the simple “Hi, I’m Bob” can initiate almost any interaction, a simple “it’s been a pleasure chatting with you…” can wrap one up. While one of your calls-to-actions is to get your new connection’s contact information, you can conclude the conversation a few ways: 


* “It was a pleasure chatting with you, and I am going to take a look at who I might know in the energy industry...may I have your contact information to follow up?”
* “It was a pleasure chatting with you and I would welcome the opportunity to chat more about your specific company...may I have your contact information to follow up (or) what is the best way to follow up?”
* “It was really great chatting with you. I'm going to take a look at some of the other presentations, but if we don’t run into each other later, I’d love to continue our conversation another time.”
* “I’m going to the Women in Tech meetup next week - are you going to be there? Looking forward to seeing you!”
* “It’s been great meeting you -- I need to talk to a few other people here. Have a great night!”
* “I am really interested in learning more about (topic you know) -- could I buy you coffee next week and pick your brain?”

<br>
**Follow up and follow through**

You should always follow up with people you meet at networking events within 24 hours, so that your conversation will still be fresh in their mind. A follow up email is the best place to add value, and should consist of the following:

* Reminder of how you met - and gratitude. Let the person know you enjoyed meeting them!
* Reminder of what you talked about
* Value add
* Next steps/when can we meet again

<br>
Here is an example of a follow-up email:

*Hi Eva,*

*It was so great meeting you at the Expat Women event on Tuesday! I loved hearing your story about how you accidentally ended up falling into tech.*

*Here is the link to that article I mentioned about rapid prototyping diversity.*

*I’m really interested in learning more about your plans for your new consultancy, and seeing if I could be a resource for you. Are you available this Thursday to grab a coffee and chat?*

*Speak soon,*
*Mary Ann*
