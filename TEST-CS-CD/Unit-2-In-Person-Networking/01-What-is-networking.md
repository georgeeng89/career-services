# What is Networking?

## Lesson Objectives:
By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
 - Explain what networking is and why it is an important part of the job process.
 - Identify various places/outlets for networking 
<br>
<br>

## Rationale:

Most people find jobs through their networks - and companies prefer to hire people they know. “Networking” is a term that is often thrown around, so it’s important to understand what it means in the context of a career change and a job search.

There are not many people who will proudly proclaim “I love networking!” 

The verb often conjures up images of contrived, anxiety-raising gatherings and shallow conversations crammed together into a one- or two-hour period.

In reality, networking is just about connecting with others, and building those connections through shared interests. When you are on the train in the morning and you strike up a conversation, you are networking. When you are at a birthday party of your best friend and chatting with their college roommate, you are networking. Only 10% of the events you might attend will have the word “networking” in them, but all of them are an opportunity to **make new connections**, and **build relationships**.

When done correctly, networking is a lifestyle, not an event. It is authentic, is based on shared interests, and benefits all parties. 

<br>
Your network consists of people you know. Some people, like your family and friends, you may know well. Other people, like the recruiter you just met, may be only acquaintances. With your new brand as a Software Engineer/Web Developer or Data Scientist, your job is now to expand your network into these worlds; to increase the people you know and increase the opportunities to which you are exposed.  

While you want to expand your network, do not disregard your current network. Your roommate or aunt may not be hiring for a Software Engineer tomorrow, but they may know someone - or know someone who knows someone - who can. Networking is about sharing your story, connecting with others, and getting introductions to people who can help.

### Why is networking important?

There are several reasons that networking is important - and will continue to be important throughout your career.

First, networking will allow you to practice telling your story. In Unit 1, you spent time crafting your unique story, and creating introductory pitches. Networking is the best opportunity for you to test your story on a real audience and refine it.

Secondly, you will learn through hearing other people’s stories and developing relationships. People who are in the industry - whether they are in the exact kind of role you’re going for or not - have valuable stories and insights to share. By building up these relationships, you’ll gain a greater understanding of the industry you’re entering, and can also learn a lot about specific kinds of jobs and companies.

Third, networking can help you grow as a communicator and listener - important skills for a software engineer to develop.

Finally, from a very practical point of view, up to 85% of people find new jobs through their networks. **Companies know that hiring processes are messy and can give off very little signal about the quality of a hire.** In response to this, most companies actively look to hire people they know, and many even have incentivized programs for their employees to refer people to open positions.

The more connected you are, the more success you are likely to have with job hunting throughout your career. Tom Farley, president of the New York Stock Exchange, once said, “When I think about my own career, I owe every job I’ve ever had to networking…. networking is about collecting relationships with interesting or influential people irrespective of the immediate benefit of these relationships.”

### Where can you network?

Networking starts when you engage someone in a conversation, and start building a relationship. In tech hubs, such as the locations where Galvanize has campuses, these opportunities to engage with new people can come from almost anywhere - from the person you have randomly shared a Lyft Line with, to the person behind you at Starbucks. 

Some places to network include (but aren’t limited to!):

Parties

Family events

Work events

Meetups

Conferences

Local Events

Restaurants/Cafes

Public transportation

Email, LinkedIn, Twitter, and other social media

As you network, you will be testing out and refining your introductory pitches and how you tell your story. Try to figure out how to engage people in conversation in a way that benefits your brand, your career aspirations, and your interests. 

Eventually you will become more comfortable with strategically engaging people in conversation - but you can get started right away by just giving a friendly introduction to people you meet. And remember that you don’t have to be all business all the time - you could build a strong relationship with someone through discovering a shared love of dogs, a passion for snowboarding, or a common history.

In this unit, we will be focusing on in-person networking. In Unit 6, we will talk more about online networking.

### Types of Networking Events

Networking is like personal finance: the more channels that you invest in, the greater are your odds of success. It’s beneficial to incorporate each of the following networking mediums into your networking plan: 

**Meetups** are informal people gatherings organized around a shared interest. Some meetups consist of mingling, while others center around an activity, like presentations or working on projects. Some are a combination. Search meetup.com to find meetups related to your desired role or industry; that way, you can find seniors in the field. 

Some popular meetups are even hosted on the Galvanize campus, so make sure you check those out.

There are many web development and data science meetups, but feel free to consider meetup groups that are in a related but different field, too. For example, if your area of expertise is JavaScript, also consider a meetup for mobile development. You will meet different people, stretch your knowledge, and, if one of the attendees’ teams is hiring someone with your skillset, you’ll have less competition.

**Hackathons** are one-off, sprint events, where a large number of people break into teams and collaborate on software projects, which are usually united around a single theme, like a programming language or social cause. These events last between a day and a week, and, at the end, projects are presented and prizes are awarded to the team with the best solution. 

Teams comprise everyone involved in the development process, from programmers and data scientists to graphic designers and project managers.

**Informational Interviews,** according to an article in the US News and World Report, are “one-on-one conversations with someone who has a job that you might like, who works within an industry you might want to enter, or who is employed by a specific company that you're interested in learning about.” In a nutshell, informational interviews are getting coffee with someone who you want to know more about. You’ll learn more about informational interviews in Lesson 4. 

**Impromptu, casual conversations** are not to be discounted! Consider all of the people who work from Galvanize - do you know all of them? If not, introduce yourself the next time that you’re in the kitchen and see someone who you don’t know. Say, “Hey, are you one of the members here? Awesome! I’m one of the web development students. What does your company do?” The same goes for all of your daily activities—cycling class, the train, your friend’s dinner party…. You never know where the conversation might lead.
