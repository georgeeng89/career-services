### What is an informational interview?

According to U.S. News (https://money.usnews.com/money/careers/articles/2012/07/26/what-is-an-informational-interview-anyway), an informational interview is “a one-on-one conversation with someone who has a job you might like, who works within an industry you might want to enter, or who is employed by a specific company that you're interested in learning about.”

Many people, hearing the word “interview”, mistakenly think that an informational interview is another part of the interview process at a company. However, in this situation, you are not the one being interviewed - *you are the one interviewing someone else.*

### Why are informational interviews useful?

An informational interview is a great way for you to get a better understanding of a certain industry that you’re interested in, or what the job market is like right now. Importantly, informational interviews can also help lead you to new job opportunities.

Note: **People like talking about themselves!** In fact, when you have a conversation with someone, and make it all about them, and engage in what they have to say and their story, they are very likely to walk away from the conversation feeling positive overall about the interaction. They may or may not realize why they feel this way - but they will almost definitely associate that feeling with you.

This makes informational interviews a great tool for jobseekers, because they allow jobseekers to quickly build a positive relationship with someone. Very frequently, these relationships can lead to referrals for open positions.

Another reason informational interviews are great for jobseekers: If you manage to get an informational interview with someone who works at a company that you are interested in applying to - either before you apply, or even in the early stages of your interview process - you can gain a major advantage by *learning inside details of the company.* These details may reveal major pain points the company is dealing with that you can resolve, or what the company is looking for in an ideal candidate, or how a target position will be adding value to the company.

By learning this valuable information ahead of time in an informational interview, you are giving yourself a big leg up, because you will be able to address the issues most relevant to the company during your actual interviews that follow.

### How to do an informational interview

The first step in doing an informational interview is to identify someone you are interested in learning more about. 

This might be a person who works at a company you are interested in, knows a technology you are learning, is working on projects or research that interest you, is in a certain industry, or holds (or has held) a role you are targeting.

When you reach out to someone to ask for an interview, remember:

* Get to the point quickly - why is this person specifically of interest to you?
* If you have anything in common, or know any people in common, make sure to mention that
* Say you have a few questions and ask for a quick conversation - either by phone or offer to take the person out to coffee
* Give the person an easy out: “I understand if you’re too busy!” This will improve your chances of a response - even if it’s only a negative one - instead of getting ignored. Even a negative response and a follow-up can lead to a future relationship.
* Don’t be afraid to follow up a week afterwards if you initially get no response

Next, **do your research.** Try to learn as much as possible about the person, his/her job, industry, projects they have worked on, how they got to be where they are, etc.

Third, **create a list of specific questions.** These questions should all be things that you cannot easily find an answer for online. If someone gives you some of their valuable time with an informational interview, the last thing you want to do is disrespect him/her by wasting that time with questions that could be easily Googled or found on their profile.

For example, instead of asking what the person’s company does (which could probably be found on the company web site), ask what the person’s favorite project is that she has worked on since being employed by the company.

When you have your list of questions, *actually bring it with you to the interview,* as well as a pen to take notes on the person’s answers. While this interview, like company interviews, will ideally end up taking the form of a conversation, it’s very appropriate to show that you respect the person’s answers by taking some quick notes. This will also be useful for your reference later on.

(Note: it’s better to take these notes by hand if you are meeting in-person; it can feel quite impersonal to sit behind a computer screen if you are meeting with someone.)

**Be prepared to keep asking questions.** If they are able to give you more time and can answer more questions - take advantage of it! Don’t bring the conversation back around to yourself. 

Finally, **follow up afterwards with a thank you note.** In your note, you should thank the person for his or her time, and mention something specific that you talked about to show that you got value from the interview. Add value for the person, if possible. 

A thank you note should ideally be sent the same day, and definitely within 24 hours.

### Pro Tips

* **Set time expectations ahead of time - and stick to them.** People are very busy nowadays, and are often wary of giving up any free time for informational interviews because they think they could drag on and eat into other priorities. Set a time expectation ahead of time so the person knows how long you want to talk. If you are worried about keeping within that time frame, set your alarm on your phone (on vibrate) and have it go off in your pocket a few minutes before the allotted time is up, so you have some buffer time to close the conversation. Only continue the conversation longer than you agreed to if the other person insists that it’s ok.

* **Ask for an unconventional amount of time.** This is another tip angled towards the busy person. When you ask for 15 or 30 minutes of someone’s time, they are more likely to think that the time commitment may not be honored. Instead, ask for 17 minutes of someone’s time. You may catch their attention with the lesser-used number, and they will likely be more willing to give you a chance!

* **Send questions across in advance.** If you have 5 or 10 questions that you would like to ask, it’s ok to send them across to the person in advance! This will give them a chance to prepare, and you could end up getting more thoughtful responses.

* **Be prepared to talk about yourself.** Our conversation conventions dictate that when a person asks you a lot of questions about yourself, you should eventually reciprocate and ask questions in return. Be prepared to talk about yourself **IF** the person asks you questions - but *do not intentionally turn the conversation towards yourself.* This is a great opportunity to let the person know what you’re interested in, get some tailored advice, and get a referral for the company if there is a suitable open position.

* **Ask: “Do you know anyone else who would be a good person for me to talk to?”** At the end of the informational interview, don’t directly ask for a favor (such as a referral into their company). However, you should ALWAYS ask the above question before leaving an informational interview. It can lead to warm referrals for other informational interviews, or for job referrals either at the person’s company or another one the person knows of. It’s best to ask this question at the end of the interview, but if you forget, you can also ask this in the follow-up email.

* **Follow up.** Start doing informational interviews before you are actively on the job hunt. In the weeks and months that follow, check back in to let the person know about your progress in your course, and to add value in any way you can. This will help to continue to build the relationship. When you do finally hit the job market, let the person know - if you have kept in touch, this could lead to recommendations or referrals for jobs.

* **Do NOT ask for a job.** If the conversation naturally comes around to topics of employment, or the person you’re interviewing offers this kind of help - great! But you should never ask for a referral for a job. You will make the person feel like you had an ulterior motive, and did not really care to learn about them.
