<br>
<br>
## Rationale:
Even if you have your pitch ready, understand the value of networking, and know the ideal networking process, it can still be difficult to get started - especially if you are introverted. The following networking hacks are specifically aimed at people who find the idea of networking intimidating, so they can get out and get started - and realize it’s not as bad as it seems!

<br>
<br>
### Networking Trick #1: Reach out before an event

If an event has a public speaker list or guest list, feel free to reach out to someone ahead of time, and let them know you’re excited to see them at the event, and introduce yourself. Once the event rolls around, you will have a built-in intro: “I’m Kara, I sent you the LinkedIn message last week…”

<br>
### Networking Trick #2: Use the buddy system...or don’t

If it feels scary to attend a meetup or event alone, ask one of your outgoing classmates to join you. You can keep each other accountable, and have group conversations. But, if you know that bringing another person means that you’ll talk to them the entire night instead of interacting with new people, it’s better to force yourself to go solo.

<br>
### Networking Trick #3: Have - and be - a networking “wingman”

Partner up again for this one - but with the explicit goal of making introductions for the other person. It can be a lot easier to boldly walk up to someone and introduce your fantastic cohort-mate. Aim to make a certain number of introductions for each other.

<br>
### Networking Trick #4: Set goals

Speaking of which, setting goals is a great way to take a task that can seem enormous and make it seem more manageable - especially when you’re already strapped for time during your immersive program. Instead of thinking as a networking event as a 2-hour commitment, promise yourself that you will go in and have 3 good conversations (or 1, or 5, depending on your time limits) and then you can leave.

<br>
### Networking Trick #5: FORD smalltalk

If you find yourself running out of ideas to talk about, keep in mind the FORD acronym. No, this doesn’t mean talk about cars! It stands for “Family, Occupation, Recreation, Dreams”. These are all topics that are generally safe to ask about, and can get people talking!

(Keep in mind that while it’s ok to talk about family during a casual networking situation, you shouldn’t talk about family during a formal interview situation.)

<br>
### Networking Trick #6: If you feel uncomfortable, look for the other uncomfortable people

When you go to a meetup, there are often clusters of people mingling and a handful of others who are standing or sitting alone. The loners are probably just as uncomfortable as you are, and would appreciate it if you approached them. Instead of trying to mingle with everyone, introduce yourself to one of these loners and be their buddy for the evening. Having a deep conversation with one person, instead of shallow conversations with many people, increases the likelihood that you’ll turn this stranger into an acquaintance.

<br>
### Networking Trick #7: Use the “notice” technique

This means: notice something about them, then ask about it. For example, if you see the person is wearing a Seattle Seahawks jersey, you can say, “I see that you’re a Seahawks fan; did you watch the game last night?” And go from there.

<br>
### Networking Trick #8: Gamify it!

Really at a loss for what to talk about? Don’t know who to approach? Make a game out of it! Decide on a random feature or accessory, and commit yourself to talking to every person that has that thing in common. Best part? You now have a built-in conversation-starter. For example, if you decide to talk to everyone who is wearing a red shirt, you can start the conversation with, “I love your shirt!”

(Stay away from personal physical appearance for this one!)

### Networking Trick #9: Opt for task-focused events

There are plenty of gatherings that don’t involve a lot of or any mingling. If meetups and large crowds of strangers intimidate you, informational interviews are a great alternative, since they’re one-on-one. And if you volunteer at an event, you will have a task to do, which takes the pressure off, but will still be able to meet new people (including the organizer, who can be the best person to mingle with, as they tend to be well connected).

### Networking Trick #10: Learn to shake it off

Sometimes you will talk to someone who just doesn’t want to talk to you. Try to accept it, shake it off, and move on. This happens and it’s ok - and almost definitely isn’t because of you!
