# Getting an Offer

## Unit Objectives:
By the end of this unit, you will be able to:
 - Explain how and why job applicants have negotiating power when offered a new job
 - Create an ideal salary range, based on your market and qualifications
 - Give examples of how to respond in specific, common negotiation situations
 - List the different pieces of an offer that can be negotiated

## Rationale
The job search culminates in receiving one or more offers from companies. It’s important to be able to accurately judge the fairness of those offers, and maximize your chances of getting a great compensation package.
Surely, the happiest part of a job search is receiving an offer. Negotiating an offer, on the other hand, can be nerve-racking. 

This unit should help. It covers what you need to know when discussing compensation with an employer, including the many components that comprise compensation, guidelines around when and why you should or should not negotiate, what to do when you’re asked about your compensation requirements before receiving an offer, and negotiating an offer.
