# Lesson 4: The Actual Negotiation

## Lesson Objectives: 
By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
 - Explain what parts of an offer can be negotiated
 - Name 4 negotiation tactics
 - Name other ways - apart from base salary - that you can get more money in your offer

## Rationale: 
It’s important to understand what parts of an offer can be negotiated, and have some strategies at hand to do so when the time comes. 

### The Actual Negotiation

In the previous lesson, we discussed how to handle the offer phone call. You’ve gathered your information, you done your research, and you’ve notified all the other companies you’re talking to that you have an offer on the table. Now, let’s dive into the actual negotiation process.

But first…

### What can actually be negotiated?

You may be surprised to learn that most elements of an offer can be negotiated. These include, but are not necessarily limited to:

* Base salary
* Annual bonus
* Signing bonus
* Relocation bonus
* Tuition reimbursement
* 401K
* Insurance contributions
* Sick time
* Vacation time
* Stock options
* Start date
* Review date
* Job title
* Responsibilities and opportunities
* Professional development opportunities and budget
* Work schedule
* Commuting reimbursement

From Exercise 1, you already know what your walk away point is, and what kind of living wage you need to have to be happy. Now, let’s get into the details of negotiating in different circumstances!

### Schedule a Time to Reconnect

The day before you said that you would reconnect with the employer, or if you’re ready earlier, email the employer to request a time to discuss the compensation package over the phone. (Don’t negotiate over email, as it creates emotional distance—it’s easier for an employer to say “no” to a computer than a human who they’re actively talking to—and email creates the opportunity for tone to be misinterpreted.) 

For example,

Hi, Sabine,

I’m excited about the offer and was wondering if you have some time tomorrow to discuss a few questions that I have?

I look forward to speaking with you!

Best,
Darnell

### Tactic 1: Delay until you have all other offers on the table

If you have timed your interviewing process very well, you may find yourself in the happy situation of having multiple offers on the table at once. This means you have a great BATNA - and therefore, you have a lot of negotiating power.

(Even if you didn’t originally time your interviews well, hopefully once that first offer came in, you managed to delay long enough to give other companies a chance to catch up!)

When you have multiple offers at once, you can compare them side-by-side across multiple factors. Refer back to Exercise 1, where you listed your priorities. In case you’ve forgotten what the list includes, here they are again:

* Location
* Reputation
* Salary
* Benefits
* Vacation Time
* Company Ethics
* Company Industry
* Company inclusiveness
* Type of work (ie., data analyst vs data scientist)
* Physical work space
* How much you like your coworker
* How much you respect your boss

You’ll notice that some of these are things that you cannot change - such as the location of the company, its reputation, its ethics, industry, inclusivity, physical work space, and your relationships. On the other hand, salary, benefits, and vacation can all be negotiated. One aspect - the kind of work you will do - may or may not be negotiable.

For now, only focus on these aspects that cannot be negotiated. Rank your current offers from first to last based on those priorities, in order of importance.

The company and offer at the top of your list should, theoretically, be your first choice company - as long as you can negotiate favorable terms around the negotiable aspects, such as salary, benefits, and vacation time. 

This is easiest if you have another offer that has great terms on those aspects. Especially in competitive markets, many companies will match the offer that another company has extended if they know it will get you to sign. 

Always start by negotiating the base salary. This is the big-ticket item - and after this, all the other negotiations tend to be much easier. Usually, this negotiation is fairly straightforward.
Call up your recruiter and say something like, “Hi Amanda! I wanted to thank you again for the offer. I’m so excited about the idea of joining CareMessage - you guys just about check all the boxes for what I’m after as far as company culture, mission, and interesting technical challenges! But I wanted to talk to you about some of the details of the offer. I actually have another offer on the table at $140,000, which is the level I’m looking to be at in my next role. That’s the only thing that’s causing me some hesitation right now. If you could work your magic and match that salary, I’d be really happy about moving forward with CareMessage.”

But what do you do if you have no other offers, or none of them have a great salary you can use to increase your target offer? Negotiations get a little more difficult, but are still very possible!

### Tactic 2: Ask where the wiggle room is

Amazingly, even when you have no other offers on the table, negotiation is often still an option. It won’t be quite as straightforward as when you have a great BATNA that your recruiter is sure to understand, though.

You can approach these conversations by using non-offensive terms like “wiggle room”, and feeling out where there is flexibility in the offer. For example:

“Hi Sarah! Thanks again for taking the time to deliver the offer yesterday. I’m super excited by the idea of joining CareMessage, but after having had the evening to think and talk to my family, the current offer just isn’t quite at the level I’m looking for in my next role. Where do you have wiggle room on that?”

“Sarah, this is a genuinely difficult decision for me to make right now. There are a few places where, if we could improve this offer, it would be an easier decision to make. Let’s talk about where there is some wiggle room.”

These scenarios put the pressure back on the recruiter - she will likely respond by asking what, exactly, it is that you’re looking for. Again, start with base salary. Present your counter offer - making sure it is within a reasonable range for the position, but a little bit higher than what you actually want to receive.

It is likely the recruiter will need to go away to get approval for the new offer. If she comes back to you with the salary approved, then you can discuss any smaller details at that point before closing the deal.

### Tactic 3: Re-sell Yourself

If you feel negotiations are going to be tough, be ready to re-sell yourself with all the information you’ve been gathering throughout the interview process, through the offer, research you’ve done since then. 

“Hey Sarah! Thanks so much for taking the time to put together that initial offer. I’m really excited about the idea of working with CareMessage, and I know you guys are looking for someone who can [ADD VALUE IN A SPECIFIC WAY], and I’m confident I will be able to do that. But I’m going to need to get numbers closer to $130,000 in order to make this decision. Let me know what you think!”

### Tactic 4: The Hard Close

If you know that you would like to accept an offer, and you know your recruiter is motivated to close the deal (which they almost always are), you can use this to your advantage to make an aggressive push for a negotiation.

“I’m really excited about working with CareMessage and I know everyone would like to get this process wrapped up. If you can work your magic and get the salary to $140,000, I can sign today and stop my other processes.”

If your recruiter has your word that you will sign as long as they can get you a certain number, they will likely do anything possible to get that number. If he or she manages to do so, make sure you keep your promise - sign and stop interviewing with other companies.

### What if they can’t negotiate?

Sometimes, a company cannot move past the salary they initially offered, or they cannot reach the salary you’re asking for. If the company comes back to you and tells you they cannot get the offer to where you want it, the offer will almost always still be on the table in its original form. At this point, if the base salary is above your living wage and is a number you’re willing to consider, try negotiating all the other aspects of the offer to make it as attractive as possible.

You don’t need to make a decision right away - see how the improved offer lines up with any other offers you have, and also compare it to your BATNA to make a decision about how to proceed.

### Other ways to make up money

If the company cannot move more on base salary, remember that there are several other areas where you can make up money:

* Additional equity
* A signing bonus (you should always ask for one! Many companies only give these if they are asked for)
* Annual bonus
* Relocation bonus
* Benefits
* Salary review (if they can’t give you more money now, can they consider it again in 6 months? Get it in writing!)
* Start date
* Vacation days

### Psychological tricks for negotiations

The strongest psychological negotiating trick you have is letting the company know that you have a strong BATNA - whatever it is. If you don’t have another offer, but are genuinely excited about the possibility of traveling the world for 6 months, that can be just as great an incentive to the company to make their offer more appealing.

Some people are able to negotiate better by winning sympathy points when they tell their recruiter the reason they need more money. For example: “I really need to be bringing in at least $12K per month because of my student loans - can you help me get the offer to $144K? Then I would feel much more comfortable signing.” Men can also mention their need to support their families, which studies have shown is an effective negotiating technique. For women, however, mentioning family is detrimental - stay away from this!

Finally, not being the only decision-maker can make a company more eager to please. Male candidates can say things like, “I’d love to work with you, but I know my wife won’t be happy about this unless the salary is at $120,000. If you can get the offer to that level, I’d be able to sign.” (I’ve seen one company that was so eager to please the wife, they invited her to dinner with the CTO so he could negotiate with her directly!) Women, once again, need to stay away from anything mentioning family or partners - this has been shown to hurt their negotiation chances.

If women need another decision maker to refer to, try saying that you were talking about the offer with your financial advisor, and this is what he recommends…. (It, unfortunately, won’t have the same emotional power.)

### Accepting or Declining the Offer

After considering the final offer, it’s time to make a decision.
 
If you choose to accept the offer, congratulations! You can email or call the employer and tell them that you accept and are thrilled to begin working with them. 

**For example,** 

I’d like to officially accept! Where can I sign?

If you choose to reject the offer, remain kind and professional, even if you’re frustrated. Why? The world is small; you might cross paths with the employer at another company in the future, or at a local meetup. As well, you represent Galvanize and your other classmates; conduct yourself professionally so that the employer is willing to work with other Galvanize alumni who want the offer that you rejected (you can even consider recommending a classmate for the role). 

**For example,**

I really appreciate you and the team taking time to get to know me. While I’m a big fan of your company, I don’t think that this is the right choice for me at this time. If you like, I’d be glad to introduce you to two of my classmates who have similar skillsets and, I believe, would be perfect for the job. 

### Top Negotiating Tip #1: Avoid Ultimatums

You probably have an ideal compensation package in mind. It’s also likely that you’re flexible and there is a range of base salaries and benefits that you’re willing to consider. The same is true of employers. While your ideal compensation packages might not be the same, in most cases your acceptable ranges will overlap. 

The key is to keep the conversation open. Treat negotiation like your first opportunity to find a win-win outcome with your new employer, rather than a take-it-or-leave-it ultimatum.

To do this, when talking about compensation with an employer, say that you are open to a range of possibilities and are confident that if you’re the right fit for the role, you will be able to find an agreement. 

If possible, also avoid anchoring yourself to one specific number. (Tips on how to do this are in the upcoming section, Responding to a Preempting Ask.)

### Top Negotiating Tip #2: Always Use the Phone

When you talk about compensation, it’s tempting to do it over email, so that you can avoid a potentially uncomfortable conversation. Don’t do this! Negotiating in person or over the phone, while awkward, is often more effective. Here’s why:

Emails are unable to communicate tone, which means that your requests can be negatively misinterpreted. 

As well, employers make more concessions when they feel personally connected to you. It’s easy for employers to distance themselves emotionally from an email on their computer screen, but difficult to distance themselves from a human being who they’re talking to in real time.

A final thought: negotiating in person and over the phone is also uncomfortable for most employers, which gives you leverage. The employer is likely to make concessions to end the negotiation/uncomfortable situation sooner.
