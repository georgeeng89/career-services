# Understanding Your Market Value and Your Priorities

## Lesson Objectives: 
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
 - Explain how to research their market value, and give a market value range for their target career
 - Explain what factors affect salary expectations
 - List the factors that contribute to a stronger or weaker negotiating position
 - Name their BATNA

Rationale:

To secure a compensation package that you’re happy with, you should first familiarize yourself with the market. The market tells you what base salary most employers are willing to pay you for your labor. 

When you know your market value, you are better able to answer questions like “What are your salary expectations?,” know if an employer has made you a fair offer, and have an objective data point that you can refer to during negotiations.

### Researching Your Market Value

Here are three things that you can do to gage your market value:
* Consult your Career Services Manager! They have a pulse on the median salary in your city, as well as how it differs by company, and what you can expect and ask for given your specific background. 
* Check out the salary data for Galvanize graduates here: https://www.galvanize.com/citations 
* Visit Glassdoor.com/Salaries. There, you can search for the range of salaries attributed to job titles of locations that interest you. You can also check out [salary.com](https://www.salary.com/), [PayScale](https://www.payscale.com/), [Indeed Salaries](https://www.indeed.com/salaries), and the [Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/). 
* Build relationships with people who are currently working in the roles and at the companies that interest you, then ask these insiders if they know how much someone with your background should expect for the roles that you’re considering, or what their company’s pay range is for those roles. 
* If you know the salary you want in one place, but are considering a job elsewhere, find the equivalent using a [cost of living calculator](http://www.bankrate.com/calculators/savings/moving-cost-of-living-calculator.aspx).

When you’re considering salary, you should take several factors into account. These can include…

* The job title. Did you know that “Software Engineers” often make more money than “Web Developers” - and “Data Scientists” more than “Data Analysts”? Within each field, as well, you can expect different salaries depending on how you choose to specialize (such as if you become a QA Engineer, Front End Engineer, Sales Engineer, Machine Learning Engineer, Data Engineer, or Business Intelligence Analyst).
* The Company Size. Very early stage startups will usually pay the lowest salaries - and if they are pre-seed funding, they may offer to pay in equity only. Well-funded small startups and mid-size companies will usually pay market rate. Overly-funded companies (WeWork, Uber, Airbnb) will often pay slightly higher than market rate, and the most generous salaries will usually be found at very large companies (Facebook, Google, etc. - these places not only tend to have higher base salaries, but are also public companies, so the stock grants are worth something!). 
* The Company Stage. More modern companies tend to pay higher salaries. For example, you’d expect a Sales Engineer at Google to make a lot more than a Sales Engineer at Cisco. However, some of the older companies have great benefits that newer companies don’t bother to match.
* Finances. Regardless of size and stage, companies that are doing well and making a lot of money tend to pay more; companies that are struggling tend to pay less.
* Your previous work experience and degree. If you came to Galvanize with 5 - 10 years of experience under your belt, you’ll probably command more money. If you came with no experience, you will most likely get lower offers, because you are considered more high-risk to future employers. Similarly, if you have a degree, and/or an advanced degree, especially if you have one from a brand-name school, you will probably get higher offers.
* Your time on the market. The longer you are on the market, unemployed, after finishing at Galvanize, the more desperate you will appear to potential employers - and you will be more likely to get lower offers.

### Understanding Your Priorities

Before you negotiate, you should have a strong understanding of what your priorities are and what you want out of the negotiation. Some priorities may include:

* Location
* Reputation
* Salary
* Benefits
* Vacation Time
* Company Ethics
* Company inclusiveness
* Physical work space
* How much you like your coworker
* How much you respect your boss

You should also have a good understanding of how much money you need to get by. This will help you determine if you should consider an offer if it fulfills enough of your other top priorities, or if you should walk away. 

You will explore these two elements more in the following exercise. 

Finally, you should determine how strong your negotiating power is for a certain company. Kathy Douglas, Associate Director of Career Services at Yale, gives the following chart for students to fill out to determine their bargaining power:


| Stronger Bargaining Power | True? |
|--------------------|-------------|
| You were strongly recommended to the company | |
| You have very relevant education, skills, and experience | |
| You have sold your value to the employer well during interviews | |
| There are few other candidates | |
| The employer is concerned about you taking a job elsewhere | |
| You have several offers and are not worried | |
| There are people similar to you in the company who have proven invaluable | |
| Total | |

| Weaker Bargaining Power | True? |
|--------------------|-------------|
| You’re feeling desperate | |
| You have little relevant experience/education | |
| You learned about the job through a job posting | |
| There are many equally-qualified candidates | |
| You’ve let the employer assess your value instead of strongly selling yourself | |
| Your calls are not returned or are taken by an assistant | |
| You have not networked with anyone in or related to the organization | |
| Total | |



If you find that you have more from the second chart than the first, you are in a weaker negotiating situation and you are unlikely to be able to demand as much. Some of these are factors that you can control - even early on in your career. Always keep in mind that the negotiation doesn’t really start with the job offer - it starts with the first contact you have with the company. 


### What is Your BATNA?

BATNA stands for “Best Alternative to the Negotiated Agreement”. Having alternatives always gives you more negotiating power - so it’s important to know exactly what that alternative is. 

Brad Spangler, an author for beyondintractability.org, writes: “Having a good BATNA increases your negotiating power. If you know you have a good alternative, you do not need to concede as much, because you don’t care as much if you get a deal. You can also push the other side harder. If your options are slim or non-existent, then other person can make increasing demands, and you’ll likely decide to accept them -- because you don’t have a better option, no matter how unattractive the one on the table is becoming. Therefore, it is important to improve your BATNA whenever possible. If you have a strong one, it is worth revealing it to your opponent. If you have a weak one, however, it is better to keep that detail hidden.”

What is your BATNA? Is it…
* Another job offer
* Going to back to school
* Going on vacation
* Another career
* Staying at home or pursuing hobbies

Determine what your BATNA is, and be aware of how this affects your negotiation power.
