# Getting an Offer

## Lesson Objectives: 
By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
 - Identify when the negotiation process starts
 - Give specific examples of how to avoid saying the first number, and what to do if pushed
 - Identify the three most important things to do during the first offer call
 - Identify at least three delaying tactics
 - Explain how to establish a timeline, and why you should

### Before the Offer

As we have mentioned previously, negotiations start with the first recruiter screen. 

Recruiters will often ask questions along the lines of:
* What is your salary history?*
* What is your current salary?*
* What salary are you looking to make?
* What is your salary range?

(*NB: as of January 1, 2018, employers in California will no longer be legally allowed to ask about salary history. However, they can still ask about salary expectations. Furthermore, if you ask a company about the salary range for role, they will be required to provide one.)

You should always avoid answering these kinds of questions during the interview process -- especially at the beginning, when you are in your weakest negotiating position. 

Instead, you can give an answer along the lines of:

“I’m really excited to learn more about you and what [COMPANY] is doing. Right now I’m focused on finding a great fit, where I’m going to be able to contribute a lot and learn a lot, instead of on salary. And I need to know much more about the role before I can really put a dollar amount on it. But I’m sure that if we both agree that this is a great fit, we will be able to find a package that we’re both happy with.”

##### !question

Imagine you have just finished 4 exhausting hours of whiteboarding in an onsite interview. As the recruiter is walking out, she says, “Now that you’ve been through the interview process and know more about the role here, what kind of salary are you after?” How do you respond?

The negotiations continue throughout the hiring process. In your informational interviews, in conversations with potential co-workers, and through all of your interviews. Make time in between interviews and conversations, or right afterwards, to actually write notes on the following:

* What are the company’s biggest pain points?
* What holes are they looking to fill?
* What does the company highly value in its employees?
* How do my skills/abilities match up?

Use your notes throughout the interview process to identify the best ways to sell yourself. The more selling you do during the interviews, the less you will need to rely just on great negotiating ability at the end of the process.

### The Offer Conversation

A successful interview experience will most likely end in an offer.

By the time a company decides to make an offer, they are heavily invested in you, and are going to try their hardest to get you to accept. (Don’t remember why? Go back to the Lesson 1 in this unit to review the cost of hiring.)

Therefore, when the recruiter delivers the offer, he or she will try to close you as quickly as possible. You’ll probably notice that in this call, the recruiter will be upbeat, friendly, and excited, with the aim of trying to get you so excited that you will accept an offer on the spot. 

Your goal, however, is the opposite. You want to give yourself time to make an informed decision and put yourself into a great position to negotiate.

Therefore, during the offer call, you will have three main objectives:

* Gather as much information as possible about the role
* Show enthusiasm for the role/company
* Delay your decision

Let’s address these individually.

**Gather Information**

You are going to use this phone call as a fact-finding mission. Write down (do not rely on your memory!) every single detail you can possibly get out of the recruiter:

* The job title
* Main responsibilities
* Who you would directly report to
* Base salary
* Annual Bonus
* Signing Bonus
* Healthcare benefits (medical/dental/vision)
  * What % is paid by the company?
  * Does this also cover dependents? What % is covered?
* Vacation policy
* Company holidays
* Team members
* Travel/commute reimbursement
* Parking spots
* Paid meals
* Wellness benefits
* Tuition reimbursement
* Education/professional development stipend
* Childcare support
* 401K/retirement benefits
  * Is there a company match?
* Normal working hours
* Projects you will be working on
* When they ideally want you to start
* Is equity involved? If so, what kind?
* Miscellaneous benefits
* Anything else that is important to you, such as a dog-friendly workplace

Write all these things down. If it seems like a lot...it’s because it is! You want to have as much information as possible.

Negotiations are usually difficult because of the imbalance of information between two parties. You are going to be putting yourself in a stronger position if you know more.

Another very important piece of information to try to get out of the recruiter during this phone call is why they have decided to extend an offer. Sometimes recruiters will openly tell you this information as part of the offer delivery; other times, you will have to dig a bit, such as by asking what the feedback from your interviewers was.


**Show Enthusiasm**

Happy employees tend to work harder and be more productive, and employees who are excited about a company’s product or mission will be more loyal and long-lasting. 

Therefore, if you show enthusiasm throughout your offer negotiation, you are going to subconsciously seem more valuable to your potential employer. 

Though you aren’t going to accept the offer in this phone call, make sure the recruiter knows how excited you are at the possibility of joining the team. He or she will be much more motivated to try to get you an offer you’re happy with.

Another benefit of enthusiasm? Negotiations tend to make all parties feel a little bit awkward, especially if the recruiter or employer is less experienced. Keeping an upbeat and positive attitude helps make you seem easier to work with, and makes the whole experience more palatable all around.

**Delay**

After gathering information, you want to delay making a decision.

This is important because it allows you to proceed with the negotiation on your timeline, instead of the company’s timeline. In order to be in the strongest negotiating position, you will need time to organize your interview processes elsewhere, research your options, and build your negotiation case. (Remember all those notes you’ve taken throughout the interview and during the offer conversation? You’re going to use these to build a strong case for your value in the company!)

The best way to delay is through continued interaction with the company that has just made you an offer. Tell the recruiter that you would like to talk to some people before you can make a decision, and ask the recruiter to help you arrange these talks and/or visits.

They could include:

* Going back onsite to meet the team
* Meeting with your potential manager to discuss projects and your role on the team
* Have a discussion with the CEO or founder
* Have a discussion with an investor of the company (most common in startups)
* Have a discussion with HR to talk about the benefits
* Have a discussion with finance to talk about the stock

You can also tell the recruiter that you need to talk to some of your people before you are going to be ready to make a decision. It can be effective for some people to say, “I’d love to discuss this with my family/spouse/partner, and then get back to you.”

Unfortunately, this is a tactic that seems to work best for men. Studies have shown that women who mention their spouses or families during negotiations are not taken as seriously as they otherwise would be.

**Saying a Number**

Sometimes, the recruiter will make the offer call easy on you by giving you an actual offer, with a salary already picked out.

But very frequently, recruiters will use the offer call to tell you that they intend to make an offer, tell you about the role and benefits, and then will ask you to come up with a number that you would be happy with.

Let’s try to understand this from the recruiter’s point of view. Their job is to get you through the door for a reasonable amount of money that also makes you feel happy. Additionally, it is annoying to get a salary number approved by HR, finance, your team lead, etc., only to have you turn it down, and make them go through an offer approval process multiple times.

However, without knowing what the company’s range is for a specific role, there is a very good chance that, if you say the first number, you will end up leaving money on the table.

Because of this, you should always try to avoid saying the first number. There are a few great tactics for this:

* Ask them for a number...and change the subject.
  * “Thank you so much for the offer! I’m really excited by the idea of working with Uber. If you could put together some details of the offer package, I’d be happy to discuss details then. Right now, though, could you help me arrange to meet up with my manager again? I’d really like to discuss some of the projects we might be working on together.”
* Straight up ask them for a number.
  * “I would really appreciate it if you would put together an offer based on your budget for this role and the value you think I’ll be bringing to the team.”
* Get philosophical!	
  * “I’d like to learn more about how Uber thinks of compensation. Could you explain what a typical compensation package looks like for this kind of role?”
* Turn the question on them!
  * “What is the range that you had in mind for this position, and where do you think I land in that range?”

However, you should also be ready with a Plan B. Recruiters can often push hard to get the answers they want, which can leave you feeling like you’ve blown the conversation if you don’t give a clearer response.

If you are really pushed to give a number, there are a few ways to do so that won’t lock you in too tightly to a number:

* If you were making a really high salary previously:
  * “When I was a lawyer, I was making $250,000/year. I know it’s not realistic to match that now that I’ve moved into data science. Instead of basing a number on that, I’d love to know what you think is fair compensation for this position?”
* Say a number -- as a “starting point”:
  * “I’ve done some research, and I know that students coming out of the Galvanize program make on average $111,000 in their first jobs. In addition to that, I have a Ph.D. in physics. I think the actual number would depend on a lot of factors in the compensation package, so let’s use that as a starting point. Could you tell me more about the compensation you had in mind for the role?”

**Establish Timelines**

Phew, you’ve just about mastered the offer call!

Next, it’s important to immediately start to establish a timeline for when you will be able to make a decision. It surprises some people to know that many companies will actually give you a reasonable amount of time to decide if you want to take an offer or not. After all, it is in their best interest that you make a thoughtful decision about your next move -- few things are as disappointing as spending the money to hire and train someone, only to have them leave a few months later because it wasn’t the right fit! 

(Unfortunately, some companies do not offer this professional courtesy and will try to pressure you into making a decision. To learn more about Exploding Offers, see Lesson 5 in this unit.)

However, you also want to make sure you are respectful of everyone’s time (and keep in mind - if you wait too long, the company that made the offer will get the impression you are no longer excited and are shopping their offer around - which could lead to it being withdrawn!). The exact amount of time varies by market and industry, but you can often ask for 10 days - 2 weeks to make a decision. A lot of this time will naturally be bought by your requests for additional phone calls and meetings with the team.

The first thing you should do when you get off the phone with the recruiter is to send emails to all the other companies you are in process with. Let them know that you have received an offer (you don’t need to say from whom). 

If companies are serious about you as a candidate, they will often try to speed up their hiring processes with you so that they will not lose you as a potential employee. 

As discussed in Lesson 1 of this unit, having a viable alternative makes you a more attractive candidate, and therefore puts you in a better position to negotiate. The best way to get viable alternatives is to have competing offers from different companies.

**Here is an example email:**

Hi Joe,

Hope you had a great weekend!

I wanted to update you on my timeline. I’ve received an offer from another company, and I’m hoping to make a final decision by the end of the month. 

Gusto is definitely a top choice for me right now - the technical challenges you are working on are right up my street, and I love the company’s focus on creating a positive culture.

Does making a decision by August 31st work for your timeline?

Thanks,

Betty Lou
