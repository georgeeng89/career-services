# Equity, Exploding Offers, and Other Tricky Situations

## Lesson Objective: 
By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
 - Name a number of difficult negotiating situations, and how to think about them.

## Rationale: 
Not all negotiations are as straightforward as we would like them to be. Here are some of the more difficult situations you may find yourself negotiating, and how to handle them.

### What is an Exploding Offer?

“Exploding offer” is the term used to describe an offer that is given with an unreasonable short time limit to make a decision. Exploding offers come in different forms: sometimes the company will tell you that you will lose the whole offer if you don’t make a decision quickly (usually 48 to 72 hours), or they may give you a special perk in the offer that they will take away if you don’t make a decision quickly. For example:

“We are offering you a Data Scientist role at $140,000 - but you have to make a decision in the next 2 days.”

“We are offering you the Web Development role at $74,000 with 40,000 stock options. But if you take more than 72 hours to accept, that will drop to 20,000 stock options.”

Exploding offers are, fortunately, going out of style; about 5 years ago they were very common in the startup world, but there was enough backlash that they started to lose ground. You are most likely to see exploding offers from early- to mid-stage startups that are concerned that you are not serious about them, and are just planning to use their offer to try to leverage higher offers from other companies (in most cases, they know they can’t match the offers from the big companies). 

When you receive an exploding offer and you aren’t sure if you want to accept it, it’s best to call their bluff. Though there is a small risk that the offer will be retracted, most companies would rather go back on their ultimatum than risk having to start the hiring process all over again.

“That’s really too bad. I think that [COMPANY] is really great, and that [PROJECTS] are really interesting and that I could make a big impact for you. [GIVE SOME EXAMPLES] Unfortunately, as I said, there’s no way that I can make a big life decision like this in just a few hours. I’m looking to really commit to the next company I join. And I need to be able to talk to my family before I make this kind of move. So I’m not comfortable making that kind of commitment in that time frame.”

### What is a Sliding Offer?

A sliding offer is one that comes with a range of options, and the employer asks you to choose which of the options you want. Sometimes, these options are all within a reasonable range - other times, the range will be so wide it’s ridiculous.

For example:
| | Offer 1 | Offer 2 | Offer 3|
| Base Salary | $110,000 | $120,000 | $130,000 |
| Stock Options | 5,000 shares | 4,000 shares | 3,000 shares|


| Offer # | Base Salary | Equity |
| 1 | $0 | 2.0% |
| 2 | $20,000 | 1.8% |
| 3 | $40,000 | 1.6% |
| 4 | $60,000 | 1.4% |
| 5 | $80,000 | 1.2% |
| 6 | $100,000 | 1.0% |
| 7 | $120,000 | 0.8% |
| 8 | $140,000 | 0.4% |
| 9 | $160,000 | 0.0% |

Sliding offers are a powerful psychological negotiating tool for employers for a couple of reasons:

* They make candidates feel like they shouldn’t go for the highest money, because it’s the lowest equity and will make it seem like you’re less dedicated to the company.
* They make candidates feel like they can’t negotiate because they were the ones who chose the terms of their offer.

If you do get a sliding offer, take down all the information just like you would with a normal offer and go away to think on it. When you return for the negotiation, negotiate each piece of the offer separately, so that you get terms that you’re happy with. Always negotiate base salary before equity - companies will almost always be flexible on equity if they think you’re happy enough with the base salary that you will sign.

For example, with the first offer above:

“Hey Laura! Thanks again for sending across this information for me to look at. I’ve reviewed the numbers, and fortunately, $130K is right around the range I was looking for for my next position. Let’s lock in the salary at that level. Now, let’s talk equity. I’m planning for this to be a long-term commitment, and I really believe that DoorDash has the ability to do great things. I want to be as invested in the company as possible. If you can get the offer to me at 5,500 shares, I’ll stop my other processes and sign today.”

### What if My Employer Offers Equity?

More and more companies are offering equity as part of their compensation packages. Though for the vast majority of employees, any equity grants will eventually be worth nothing, employers consider them a powerful motivating factor. They think that employees will work harder if they have a stake in the company, and will also be more loyal to the company over the long-term.

If you get an offer from an early-stage startup, equity will probably be a significant portion of the offer, since they will not be able to pay market rate salaries. Always treat these offers with caution; they’re not great to accept unless you can afford to work without pay, you really believe in the company, and you think it will be a very good learning experience. 

If you get an offer of equity, make sure you understand what it means - and make sure the company is willing to be open with you about this. If, for any reason, you sense the company is hesitating to give you full information about the valuation of the company, the value of your equity, or what percentage of the company your equity represents, treat it as a red flag - they probably have bad news about the health of the company that they don’t want to share with you!

Also, check that your equity comes with a normal vesting schedule. A normal vesting schedule means:
You will “vest” - or get the right to - 25% of your equity after you have completed one year of work.
If you leave the company for any reason in that first year - whether you quit, or are fired -  you will not get any equity at all
After the first year, you vest more equity every month - 1/36th of the remaining amount - up to 4 years at the company

You should also ask what the exercise window is. This refers the period of time after you leave the company, before you need to buy your stock options. This is important - some companies will only give you 90 days to exercise, or you lose everything you vested! Needless to say, this can be very difficult for some people, depending on what the options cost and what they are currently valued at. Not only will you need the money to buy the stock, you will also owe a tax bill on the difference between the price you pay and what the stock is considered to be worth. And at private companies, this is especially difficult since you cannot sell the stock on the stock market to make that money back. (Fortunately, many companies are realizing how unrealistic this is, and to be more competitive, are extending their exercise windows to 7 or 10 years.)

Here is a full list of questions you should ask about the equity part of your offer. If you’re not sure what any of these refer to, ask your Career Services Manager:

* What % of the company do the stock options represent?
* How many outstanding shares are there, and how much will that % be diluted in the future?
* What is the vesting schedule? (typical is one year cliff and then monthly afterwards)
* What happens to the vested shares if you leave before you have fully vested, for example, after 2 years? What is the exercise window?
* Will they allow you to exercise early?
* If the company is acquired, what happens to the stock options? what about the ones that haven’t vested yet? will they accelerate the vesting schedule?
* What is the exercise price of each share right now? how was the fair market value determined? how does the price compare to the price of preferred stock in the last funding round?
* What is the company’s current valuation? what are the stock options currently valued at?
* How much money has the company already raised? are they profitable? what is the runway (how long will they last with their current funding)?
* Do employees get awarded more stock options in the future? is this in lieu of raises? or in addition to raises?
* Is the company anticipating an IPO in the next year? 2 years? 5 years?


# How do I Determine an Hourly Rate?

Sometimes instead of a permanent job, you will be offered a contract position and will be asked to give an hourly rate. The quickest mental math way of getting an approximate hourly rate is to divide the starting numbers of your ideal annual salary (before the final 000) by 2.

For example, if your annual salary goal is $100,000, do: 100/2 = 50, or $50/hr
If your annual salary goal is $75,000, do: 75/2 = 37.5, or $37.50/hr
If your annual salary goal is $144,000, do: 144/2 = 72, or $72/hr

However, keep in mind that contracts usually don’t come with benefits, and you may owe a little more in tax. To help compensate for these factors, add 20 - 30% on top of the hourly rates above, to factor in the cost of healthcare, etc.

For example, if your annual salary goal is $100,000, your hourly rate would be $50, but you would ask for $60 - $65/hr to compensate for the lack of benefits. 

### Are Contracts a Good Idea?

Contracts can be a great way to get your foot in the door in an otherwise tough job market. Since independent contractors are less of an investment for employers than a permanent employee is, the interview processes are often faster and easier, and can give you something great to build your resume and increase your value as you continue to look for a permanent role. 

* If you decide to be a contractor, you should be aware of some of your rights, restrictions, and obligations:
* As an independent contractor, you have greater work flexibility. Your employer cannot tell you how to do the work you are supposed to do, or when to do the work, or where to do the work (ie, you can work from home at odd hours all you want!). If they do those things, they are treating you like an employee, and can get in trouble for misclassifying you and not paying the proper employee tax. Enjoy the freedom!!
* As an independent contractor, you can work for more than one company at a time. 
* As an independent contractor, you can deduct certain expenses that are related to the work you’re doing. For example, if you need to buy a new computer to get the work done, you can write that off as a work expense. You cannot do this as an employee.*
* If you are an independent contractor, you will be responsible for paying your own taxes - they won’t automatically be withheld from your paycheck. Make sure you set an estimated amount aside every time you get paid for taxes, or you may end up owing the IRS during tax season.
* As an independent contractor, you may end up paying a bit more in tax. When you are an employee, you pay 7.5% of your income to Social Security and Medicare and your employer pays 7.5%; as an independent contractor, you have to pay the full 15%. Make sure you account for this when setting your wages.*
* You will most likely be responsible for obtaining your own health insurance, and will not be able to contribute to an employer-sponsored 401K plan. Make sure you account for this when you are setting your wages.
* As an independent contractor, you are not protected by employee rights laws. You will not automatically get overtime, rest breaks, minimum wage, or protection from harassment or discrimination based on sex, disability, whistleblowing, or religion. Also, you will not qualify for the Family Medical Leave Act.

Despite the downsides, many people enjoy the lifestyle of being an independent contractor, and once you have a bit of experience, you can make a lot more money as a contractor than you could as an employee. 

If you decide to professionally be a contractor, you may want to consider starting an LLC (Limited Liability Company). This will allow you to separate your personal finances from your business finances - so, for example, if one of the companies you contract for decides they are unhappy with your work and wants to sue, they can take the money your LLC has, but not your personal money.

(*Always check with your tax professional, and double check with employment laws in your state.)

### How is Negotiating a Contract with a Recruiter Different?

Sometimes you may be offered a contract through a recruiter, as opposed to directly with a company. It’s important to understand how these contracts work so you know how much leverage you have in negotiating. 

When a company uses a recruiter to fill a contract position, they will offer an hourly wage to the recruiter - let’s say $80/hr for a data scientist. 

The recruiter has a minimum amount of profit that he or she is required to make. This will vary by company, but for the sake of this example, let’s say the recruitment company requires at least $30/hr from this recruiter in order to consider this a worthwhile deal. 

This means the recruiter now needs to find someone willing to do the contract work at $50/hr or less. The lower the rate, the more money the recruitment company gets to keep. 

This can make negotiations in this situation tricky. If the recruiter in this scenario offers you the job at $30/hr, there is a lot of room for negotiation - up to $50. But if the recruiter offers the job at $50/hr, there is absolutely no room to negotiate, and if you push too hard, the recruiter will just move on to the next candidate. They are hired to fill these kinds of roles quickly - usually within days - and they can’t waste time negotiating. 

This makes negotiation tricky because, of course, you as the candidate never know whether the recruiter has offered a maximum amount. Keep in mind that usually if they have the ability to move on the hourly rate, they will, even if it’s only by a little bit - because timing is their main priority and they want to get you started as quickly as possible.
