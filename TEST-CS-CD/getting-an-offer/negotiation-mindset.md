# The Negotiation Mindset

## Lesson Objectives: 
By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
 - Explain the different components of compensation
 - Explain why everyone should negotiate
 - Explain why employers are highly motivated for you to accept an offer

## Rationale:
 - 59% of people—and 68% of women—accepted the salary they were offered and did not negotiate
 - It’s usually a good idea to negotiate when you get an offer
 - You salary should be based on fair market value, not your previous salary. 
 - Employers expect you to negotiate and prepare their first offer accordingly; they won’t be surprised or offended
 - “It's estimated that people who negotiate earn $1 million more during their career for no other reason than negotiating.”

### Understanding Compensation

Success negotiations begin with understanding compensation. 

Foremost, compensation is more than a number. It considers every positive and negative attribute of a job, from the proposed base salary to the amount of time required to commute to and from work. 

The following chart cites the most common items that comprise compensation. When deciding to accept or reject an offer, each component should be thoughtfully considered and weighed.

|Monetary: Base salary, equity, stock options, bonuses, health care, 401(k), perks (transportation, meals, gym membership)|Happiness: Start date, manager, coworkers, hours, workspace, type of work, commute, ability to work from home |
|Future Potential: Title, job function, mentorship, growth opportunities | Miscellaneous: Visa sponsorship, maternity/paternity leave, accommodations for disabilities or handicaps, pet-friendly workspace | 

Here’s a closer look at each of the items listed in the chart above: 

**Monetary**

Base salary is often considered to be the most important monetary component of an offer because, unlike equity, bonuses, and other perks, it is guaranteed. Equity is akin to being paid in lottery tickets, and bonuses are subject to change or disappear over time.

Most full-time employers are required to provide employees with a health care plan. Learn the details of that plan—what it includes and how much, if any, you need to pay out of pocket. 

Another common perk of full-time employment is a 401(k), an employer-sponsored retirement savings plan, which allows you to contribute a piece of your paycheck to your 401(k) savings account before taxes are taken out. Many companies are willing to match a percentage of the amount that you contribute.

**Future Potential**

Titles should reflect the work that you’re doing. And they matter, because when viewing your resume and online portfolios, prospective employers pay attention to titles. A strong title can improve your chances of being contacted by a prospective employer, while a weak or unfitting title can weaken your chances. 

Some companies offer more internal growth opportunities than others. If you work hard and do a good job, are you likely to be promoted in due time or will you need to change companies to move up?

Finally, working on a team of seasoned developers/data scientists who can provide you with mentorship can accelerate your abilities and broaden your skills, making you a more attractive candidate for future roles. 

**Happiness**

Even if the numbers are right and the title looks great on your resume, are you going to be happy in this role? Monday through Friday. This boss. These coworkers. That office. This schedule and workload. That commute.

If the actually day-to-day of the job doesn’t sound appealing, it might not be worth it. 

**Miscellaneous**

Consider any unique needs that you have, from visa sponsorship to a certain length of maternity or paternity leave, to an ergonomic standing desk, and find out what the company is willing to provide. 

### Why You Should Negotiate

**Employers Plan for Negotiation**

Consider the car dealership. There is a price tag listed on each car, yet that number is malleable, it can always go down… as long as the buyer is willing to do the dance of negotiation. 

The same is true with salary negotiation; the first compensation package that you’re offered needn't be the last. You just need to be willing to negotiate. 

In most cases, employers expect you to negotiate; they plan for it. Meaning, what you are offered initially is less than what employers are prepared to give you—they are ready to give you more if you negotiate. 

**Asking for More Communicates Your Worth**

Imagine that you go to the store to purchase a microwave and there are several options, each with a different price. Naturally, you assume that the most expensive microwave is also the highest quality, and that the least expensive microwave is the lowest quality. 

The same is true of most things, including how employers view you. If you don’t contend for a salary that matches your market value, employers might wrongly view you as less valuable than you are. 

**Your Next Raise is Based off Your Base Salary**

If you plan to stay at the same company for a long time, negotiating the best possible base salary is important, as that base salary is often used to calculate your raises and bonuses.

### Common Negotiation Misconceptions

Many people are afraid to negotiate because they fear that they will ruin the relationship they have built with their potential employer. As long as negotiations are handled in a respectful way, and as long as you are dealing with a mature person, this should never be the case. As mentioned above, negotiations are so common that many employers actually make a lower first offer because they expect a counter offer!

Others say that they do not want to negotiate because they are afraid that they will appear greedy. You will not look greedy! Instead, you will look like you value your skills and know your market value.

Finally, keep in mind that your potential employer is forming an opinion of you throughout the interview process - even when you enter into negotiations. If you accept an offer - even a low one - too quickly, they may subconsciously feel that you are desperate and value you less highly. Always keep in mind that employment is a mutual deal and you are selling your services for a fair price - you are not begging for a job.

Also, it’s always good to keep in mind that, once you get to offer stage, most employers are highly motivated to close the deal - even if it requires some negotiation. This is because hiring is very expensive.

**The Cost of Hiring**

To understand more about the employer mindset when they get to offer stage, it’s good to break down just how expensive it is - in time and money - to hire someone.

Using the San Francisco market as an example, you could assume that every hour of recruiting time costs about $100 to the employer, and every hour of technical talent time costs about $150.

Let’s break down what the costs are in a typical hiring process for a mid-level engineer or data scientist.

* The recruiter and the hiring manager spend about 2 hours together writing a job description ($500)
* A sourcing recruiter spends about 10 hours outbound sourcing for the role ($1000)
* ...while the lead recruiter posts the job on several job boards (let’s estimate $500 - job boards are expensive!)
* The recruiter gets thousands of applicants and looks through about 600 resumes ($600)
* Which leads to 30-minute phone screens with the top 25 candidates ($1250)
* The recruiter spends an hour sending out take-homes to the candidates ($100)
* ...which 15 candidates return. It takes an engineer about 2 days to go through the takehomes and choose who will move to the next round. ($2400)
* He then does hour-long phone screens with the top ten candidates ($1500)
* The top five candidates are asked to onsite interviews, costing 7.5 technical hours each ($5625)
* ...which also means you’ve lost 5x7.5 hours of productivity. Depending on how you value productivity, this could range from around $2500 to over $14000.
* The top candidate is picked! The recruiter checks references ($200)
* The recruiter gets various stakeholders to sign off on an offer package ($300)
* The recruiter calls up the candidate, delivers the offer, delivers all kinds of extra information, and starts the negotiation process ($400)
* The candidate wants to come back onsite to meet the team again (~$900)
* The candidate gets a better offer elsewhere and declines!
* The recruiter does the reference checks for the 2nd choice candidate ($200)
* The recruiter puts together a similar offer package and gets all necessary signoffs ($100)
* The recruiter delivers the offer, has to do some ego boosting since this candidate is sad he had to wait so long to hear back from the company ($300)
* The recruiter invites the candidate back onsite to meet the team again and hopefully seal the deal ($900)
* And finally, the candidate accepts!
* Unfortunately, the time to hire was 68 days - the current average in the Bay Area. Using a very, very conservative figure of $500/day in lost productivity, the cost for taking that long to hire is $34,000. (This figure could be much, much higher depending on the role and the company.)
* Which leaves us with a hiring cost of $53,275 on the most conservative end.

When you see hiring costs like that, it’s suddenly very understandable why companies will pay recruitment companies fees of 25 - 35% of the candidate’s starting salary to help them find the right people and speed up the process!

It also explains why, if a company decides to make you an offer, they really, really want you to accept it. In the long run, it costs them much less to give you a few extra thousand dollars than it does to risk starting the recruitment process all over again.

Of course, some companies really will make their best offer up front, though this is rare. You’ll never know if it’s the best offer, and it’s still in your interest to try to negotiate. If they can’t budge, they will usually tell you, and you can make a decision on the offer based on your priorities.

In the next lesson, we will talk more about understanding market value, and understanding your personal priorities when going into a negotiation.
