# Starting a Job

## Unit Objective

By the end of this unit, you will be able to start a new job with confidence and set the foundation for creating a long-term impact.

## Unit Overview

The first few months on a new job are the most critical; they are when your coworkers will form opinions of you, and how you act during this period can get you off on the right foot for years to come - or not. In this unit, you will learn how to approach the challenges that come with a new job, and create a gameplan for your first 90 days.
