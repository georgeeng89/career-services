## Lesson Objectives: 
By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
 - Explain why the first 90 days on the job are so critical
 - Explain what managers tend to expect of new hires
 - Explain why new hires fail
 - Give a suggested timeline of the first 90 days

## Rationale: 
Now that you’ve done the hard work to get a job, you need to make it count. The first 3 months in a new role are critical for determining whether you will ultimately succeed or fail in the job.

### Why are the first 90 days so critical?

Unsurprisingly, the first three months in a new job can be the most difficult time in the role. You’re going through a lot of transition, and you have a lot to learn - quickly. 

Unfortunately, this overwhelming time is also one that may indicate your long-term success in the role. A survey conducted with over 1,000 HR professionals showed that they see new employees struggle the most during this transitional time period, and that problems that employees have later in their tenures at a company can almost always be tracked back to those first three months. Because of this, how you do in this time period can be an indicator of how you will do in the job overall. 

Unfortunately, the first 90 days are also the most difficult - for many of the same reasons. During this time, you’re under the microscope. When people meet you for the first time, they quickly for opinions, and those opinions can be difficult to change. While on the one hand, this means you have the opportunity to quickly build credibility with your team, on the other hand, it can be difficult to rebound from failures. And those failures are all the more likely since you don’t know anybody or the role. 

### Understand WHY you were hired

The first step to understanding how to make the first 90 days a success is to try to think from your manager’s point of view. When you manager hired you, he or she did so for good reason. They had a plan for how you would complement the team’s culture, how your skill sets would help them solve problems, and how you would represent the company’s values.

Take a moment and reflect on the following questions. When you start your new job…

* What will you be doing?
* How will you be doing it?
* Who will you be doing it with?

Now, try to imagine how your manager would answer those questions about you. Do you think your expectations for the role are in line?

If you are in line, you’ll be satisfying basic expectations. Since this is a critical time for first impressions, however, you ideally want to come across as better than average. Before you go to work on the first day, also spend time reflecting on the following:

* What are the company’s biggest business challenges? How are you going to help solve them?
* What are the key responsibilities for the role? How will you manage them?
* How will your past experience and education help you do the role?
* What hard skills do you have that are relevant?
* What soft skills do you have that are valuable?
* What could limit your success in the role? 
* What will you learn in the role?

### What is your manager hoping for?

Talent advisor and former recruiter Carl Sweet has conducted surveys with several companies about what they are actually hoping for in their new and junior hires. Look at the responses to the questions below. What do you see that you expected to see? What do you see that surprised you?

**Question: What do you look for in an intern?**
* “Standard qualifications – tech knowledge.  Differentiator – Energy level, Ability to bring fresh ideas/thoughts and ask lots of questions.”
* “Smart, a thirst for knowledge and wanting to make a change.  A personal interest in the space where we need help.”
* “Intellectual curiosity – I want to see examples of situations where the person has enough understanding of why things work the way they do.  For example, if the person tells me she uses the Chrome web browser because it is much faster than Firefox, I expect the person to have some idea about what are the top 2-3 reasons that Chrome is so fast.  The key point here is even though a web browser is something we all take for granted, an Engineer should be curious enough to look underneath the covers because it shows they don’t believe in “magic”, but understand the system they depend on.”

**Question: What do you look for in someone who just graduated?**
* “Standard qualifications – tech knowledge.  Differentiator – Energy level, Ability to bring fresh ideas/thoughts and ask lots of questions.”
* “Tech knowledge, what courses and projects did the engineer complete, internships, new ideas….”
* “Intellectual curiosity”
* “Humility – Engineering is all about standing on the shoulders of “giants” to add value to the company and/or project.  In college, engineers-to-be are taught to write everything from scratch – data structures, sorting algorithms, etc.  When these engineers (myself included) start working in the real world, they tend to continue this practice – perhaps, they think this is a way to make their mark.  However, in the real world, writing new code before looking hard for pre-existing solutions leads to wasted time and mistakes repeated from previous attempts at “inventing the wheel”.”

**Question: What do you expect in the first year, over and above basic work?**
* “Expect new engineers to understand the entire architecture (not just their piece).  Also expect them to understand the core business and how the company makes money.”
* “Understand the company well – the values and the business drivers.  Understand the dev, QA and operational process – train with a buddy.  Give them focused bugs to start fixing – best way to learn is to jump in the pool.  Expand the scope and include specific modules, and help them in a career path that excites and motivates them.”
* “Monitor the innovation landscape for new ideas/companies.  Interns are also very knowledgeable about new research happening in academia.”
* “Focused input, high value return: Carve out an isolated problem with minimal process and other dependencies.  Team up with a caring buddy and guide the individual, and figure out answers to questions.”
* “Pick up work place skills like collaboration with other team members to achieve goals, escalating issues sooner than later so there is time for corrective actions, etc.  Essentially, these are real world skills not necessarily taught at schools.”
* “Internalize our data driven culture – typically, this is a foreign concept because we were one of the first few companies that did this initially. I find that even for people with work experience, it is hard to digest the fact that the technical merits of their ideas are meaningless unless those merits are backed up with quantifiable data like feature A will provide X seconds of performance improvements or Y% increase revenue per visit, etc.  I have heard people say this is one of the best things they like about us – with data, they can make their case heard and accepted at any level regardless of their rank/title in the company.”

### Failure and Success

HR professionals who have studied why new hires fail have noticed some patterns for why this tends to happen. These new hires tend to struggle with informal networks of communication that they aren’t familiar with yet - this means that they often miss out on vital information, especially about more subtle things like company culture. They lack credibility because they are unknown, and therefore don’t have the social influence to get things done, or compensate for their mistakes. Sometimes, a lack of familiarity with standard corporate culture can be the undoing of a new hire, especially for those who are either coming out of school, or who have previously worked for themselves or in informally-structured startups. Finally, some companies are bad at accepting new hires (which is much more out of your hands!)

Common mistakes that new hires tend to make include:
* Just sticking to what you know because it’s comfortable
* Not taking enough time to learn
* Setting unrealistic expectations and trying to do too much
* Not being flexible
* Just focusing on the technical aspects of the work and not building relationships

Instead, new hires should focus on:
* Understanding the business. Learn about the company as a whole and not just your part of the business. Aim to understand its operating model and stakeholder connections.
* Developing the right relationships. Some people only focus on building relationships with their managers and immediate team members. Keep in mind that it’s also important to build lateral relationships with people on other teams.
* Continuing to check expectations. Just like you checked expectations during the interview process, and again after the interview process in the exercise above, continue to do this as you start the job. Are things going the way you expected them to? Why or why not? What areas of the business or your work did you not account for in your previous expectation setting?
* Checking in with people apart from just your boss. 
* Adapting to the culture. Pretend you are an anthropologist studying the culture of the office. What do they do? What do they value? How can you fit into that? Some specific important aspects of the culture you should be aware of include:
* Influence. How do people get support? Do people make their own decisions, are decisions made by a team, or are they dictated from above?
* Meetings. Do people discuss difficult issues in meetings? Do people discuss personal issues? Or is it strictly business updates?
* Execution. Is it more important to know the right people or to be an expert at something?
* Recognition. How are people congratulated for a job well done? WHO is being rewarded - strong individual contributors? Team players? Managers? Business experts?
* Conflict. How is conflict handled? Is it resolved, or does it fester?
* Values. Do you see any behavior that you think crosses the line? How is this kind of thing responded to when it’s noticed by others?
* Getting to the “break even” point. With every new hire, there is a ramping up period during which the company is investing more time and energy into you than it is getting results out of you. The “break even” point is the point at which your output is equal to their input - and from that point forward, you are adding value for the company.
