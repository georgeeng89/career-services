# Feedback Delivery 

## Objectives:
* At the end of this lesson, students will be able to: 
* Articulate the benefits of timely feedback 
* Explain the concept of goal-oriented feedback 
* Deliver critical feedback that sets the stage and leaves the recipient feeling motivated 
* Determine how to prioritize feedback topics

## Rationale
Delivering feedback in person is an important skill for building interpersonal relationships and improving performance. By delivering feedback with the recipient’s emotions and experience in mind, the person receiving the feedback is more likely to hear and act upon the suggestions provided. 

### Giving Feedback Effectively
Understanding the characteristics of good feedback is only one part of what makes feedback effective. When done well and with good intentions, feedback is a powerful tool that leads to improved performance and personal growth. For feedback to be really heard and received, though, it needs to be delivered frequently and carefully. Cultivating this skill -like any other skill- takes time and repeated practice to get right. 

**Making Feedback a Positive Experience**<br> 
Before delivering feedback, take a step back and remind yourself why you are doing it. The reason we give feedback is to improve performance or a situation while affirming and reinforcing the good behaviors that already exist. For this to work, the person on the receiving end needs to feel encouraged and supported! This will not be accomplished by being overly harsh and critical. That’s not to say that there is no space whatsoever for negative feedback or even anger if someone is not paying attention to what you are saying, but it should be used carefully in tandem with positive and encouraging messaging. When you approach feedback positively with the goal of improvement, not judgement, your feedback is much more likely to be well received.

**Provide Feedback Regularly**<br> 
Feedback is an ongoing process, and delivering feedback is a skill that gets better with practice. By providing feedback regularly, people expect to receive input on their performance, always know where they stand, and don’t have to make guesses or assumptions about the impact of their actions on other people. Additionally, regular feedback prevents negative issues from getting out of hand. Regular informal feedback that happens once a week or even daily leaves few difficult surprises for formal feedback that occurs less frequently, such as in a performance review or an exit survey.

**Timeliness**<br>
If someone approached you two weeks after a large networking event and told you that they noticed you had spinach in your teeth the entire time, how would you feel? Confused? Mortified? Irritated that you are just finding this out now instead of when you could have actually done something about it? 

The sooner you can address an issue as it comes up, the better. Remember, feedback isn’t a “gotcha” or a reason to surprise someone, so the sooner you bring it up, the more likely the person will be expecting it, making it a kind process. In addition, both you and the recipient of the feedback will be more likely to remember specific details of the incident. If you wait a long time to address an issue, it’s quite possible that you will forget a few details of the event in question, making your feedback much less likely to be specific. 
Additionally, providing timely feedback gives the recipient agency to act upon it in a timely manner, improving their performance much faster. It’s definitely easier to give feedback about one hour of bad performance than it is to deliver feedback about a whole year of failed one-hour chunks of work and do damage control.

Note: The exception to this rule is when people are heated or emotional. If this happens, allow the recipient to calm down and get to a normal emotional state before providing feedback. 

**Goal-Oriented Feedback**  
While generalized feedback can be helpful, aligning your insights to goals set by the person on the receiving end of your feedback can make it extra powerful.

Imagine that, for a week, your entire class has been tasked with improving their communication skills. Telling someone that they made a really good fashion decision by pairing a sharkskin suit with alligator shoes may be pleasant to hear, but telling them that you really appreciated the way in which they articulated their roadblocks during your morning stand up ties directly into the goals that they have set, and will likely have more impact! 

### Feedback Delivery Methods
Throughout your time here at Galvanize and elsewhere, such as on the job, you may be asked to provide feedback at multiple times. Here are some of the ways in which you may be giving feedback. 

**Written Feedback**<br> 
Written feedback is usually asked for as a reflective exercise, and may happen via surveys, 360 feedback, exit surveys, and reviews. When providing feedback via written means, you may be given the option of providing this feedback anonymously. 

At Galvanize, we believe in providing non-anonymized feedback for a few reasons:
* It encourages us to be accountable for our words and gets us in the habit of providing feedback that we would be comfortable saying to someone’s face. Often hiding behind the safety of anonymity can result in feedback being actionable and specific, but definitely not kind.
* Non-anonymous feedback allows the recipient to follow up with the person giving it if additional clarification or an update needs to be provided.

**In Person Feedback**<br>  
A lot of the feedback you will encounter and provide as a part of your learning experience will be in person, or ad hoc feedback. This may occur between you and your instructor, between you and your pair programming partner, or by someone that you work with as an issue comes up. 

### Rules of Engagement: In-Person Feedback

**Get Buy In (setting the stage)**<br>
Feedback is another form of education. If you think back to the Learning to Learn module, we talked about the concept of setting the stage and clarifying the what and the why. Providing and receiving feedback is no different! In order to the recipient to be fully primed to accept the information that you are giving them, do them a favor and ask them if you may give them some feedback. This quick question gives the person on the receiving end a clue that you are about to give them some knowledge, so that they can clear their mind of distractions and focus on what you have to say.

Note: Getting buy-in does require the authorization of the person on the receiving end. If you ask to deliver feedback and the person says that they are not in the space to receive something currently, it’s important to respect this. Ask them when a good time to follow up would be if this is the case.

**Criticize in Private, Praise in Public**<br> 
Celebrating people’s success is an uplifting experience, and when done in the proximity of others, it can be motivating to a team. That being said, negative thoughts or criticism can be demoralizing to a group- and scrutinizing a person in front of others is a surefire way to make them feel attacked and defensive. While it’s important to address issues as they come up, make sure that if you have to offer criticism that you respect the person receiving the feedback by moving the conversation to somewhere private.

**Pick Your Battles**<br>
As tempting as it may be to provide every single one of your opinions in one go, it can be overwhelming to be on the receiving end of an enormous list of action items. Remember that our brains can usually hold about four chunks of information at a time. Each piece of feedback takes up one of those slots, limiting the other pieces of information and learning that can occupy our thoughts. Before you give your feedback, consider the following: 
<br>
* Is this a behavior the person can change?<br> 
* Is this something a person can influence?<br> 
* Does this feedback tie directly to this person’s goals?<br> 
* How does this feedback tie into your team’s goals?<br> 
<br>
A good rule of thumb here is to limit your critical feedback to two issues that are the most impactful and beneficial to both the recipient’s and your goals or performance. Any more than that may come off as overwhelming.<br>  
<br>
**Using “I” Statements** <br>  
You only have one perspective- yours! When providing feedback, try to speak to your own perspective and the way a person’s actions impacted you instead of labeling the person. Labeling the person can sound overly optimistic and general at best, accusatory and judgemental at worst- and it makes the feedback less actionable in general. 

For example, it’s easier to process something like “I was pleasantly surprised when you finished this part of the assignment so quickly and accurately,” as opposed to “You are such a fast worker!”

**Speak to Positive Feedback as Well!**<br>
As mentioned in a previous lesson, it’s encouraging to include positive feedback/feedforward in addition to negative feedback/feedforward. When a session starts with something positive, the person receiving feedback feels more at ease, and also has an opportunity to see what success looks like, allowing them to take the right steps in the future.<br>

If it’s authentic, ending a feedback session with a positive can also help lift a person as opposed to leaving them feeling as if they are wrong or worthless. At the same time, make sure that the full message of your feedback is coming across and is not lost in the balance of good/bad. If you sandwich important critical feedback between too many positive statements, the takeaway message may become something like “Wow, I’m doing great!” when the actual takeaway should be “I’m communicating well with others on my team, and I could do better about communicating with my instructors as well.”
