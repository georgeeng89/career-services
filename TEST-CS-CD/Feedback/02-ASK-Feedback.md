# ASK Feedback 

## Objectives: 

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:  


* Identify the three components of ASK feedback 
* Differentiate between nice and kind feedback 
* Identify benefits of ASK feedback
* Formulate feedback using four linear types and ASK structure 



## Rationale:
In addition to providing future-focused feedback, providing a clear picture of your experience to the recipient from a compassionate place allows them to act upon suggestions and fully understand their performance and opportunities for growth. 

### What makes good feedback? (the ASK method)

Good feedback has three characteristics:
 <br>
* It’s **Actionable**. The recipient can _do_ something with it instead of just say “oh, ok.” Actionable feedback provides an opportunity for the recipient to either reinforce or change how they do something in the future. This ties closely into the four linear types of feedback mentioned previously. 


* It’s **Specific**. There are details and specific instances of occasions that jog the recipient’s memory and make them think of the things that actually occurred as opposed to speaking in vague terms or making blanket statements that don’t lead anywhere.  
 
* It’s **Kind**. Meaning, it’s delivered with the intent of making this person better at what they do and who they are and is never given as an insult. All feedback should be delivered with the idea of helping the recipient be a better version of themselves future- not to make them feel bad or guilty. <br>

_Note_: “kind” is not the same as “nice.” It’s entirely possible to deliver feedback that is uncomfortable to receive and is kind at the same time. Ever have someone tell you that you have spinach stuck in your teeth or that your fly is down? That is some _kind_ feedback, friend.
 <br>
<br>
**Why does this matter?**<br>
Imagine the following scenario: your significant other is coming over to your house and you’re making them brunch! You really want to impress them, but you have no real cooking skills to speak of, so you do all of your research and manage to cook up some eggs, French toast, and you even give hash browns a whirl based upon what you can find via online recipes. They come over (thankfully after the smoke alarm stops) and you feed them. Hooray! You want to know how they like your food, so you ask them.
 <br><br>
They tell you “It sucks,” before going silent.
 <br><br>
First, _ouch_.
 <br><br>
Second, there are so many questions to be asked after hearing this. _Why_ does it suck? Do they hate eggs? Did you use too much salt? Do they hate everything with maple syrup on it? Was the black crust on your potatoes too much? Is brunch just not their thing?
 <br><br>
Lastly, the question that burns most of all: _How could you make brunch not suck so much in the future?_
<br> <br>
Now, imagine that your significant other said “Wow, this was a really nice gesture! I think I would do a few things differently next time. The scrambled eggs were nice and fluffy but I noticed that they didn’t have any seasoning on them.  I also think the potatoes were cooked a little too long. They were black on the outside and they were dry and salty. The French toast was well cooked and crisp on the outside, but I really could have used more butter and syrup to offset the saltiness of the potatoes. Do you think next time, we could cook together and add some new seasonings and recipes?”
<br><br>
This gives you a clear outline of what worked (the texture of the French toast and the eggs) what didn’t (the potatoes and lack of seasonings) and what you could try differently next time (cooking times, lower the temperature on the potatoes, add seasonings, lower the salt and add more syrup/butter, collaborate).
<br> <br>
It’s good feedback because it doesn’t hurt your feelings, and it answers more questions than it provokes.
<br> <br>
Another note: positive feedback can be bad feedback if it doesn’t follow the Actionable and Specific parts of the ASK method. Saying something was “great” is _nice_, but it doesn’t give the recipient anything to go with, making it not _kind_.
<br><br>
**Why this matters from a work perspective**<br>
ASK feedback is a tool that not only improves your communication, but it proves to be a benefit to leaders and teammates for a few reasons: 
<br><br>
**Your job will be easier.** You are literally telling someone how to act in ways that you want and deliver what you need. It’s like rubbing a magic lamp and getting wishes granted by the genie of productivity. Why wouldn’t you want that? 
<br><br>
**Their job is easier too.** The recipient knows exactly what they are doing well and what could be better. They’re not making wild guesses or (even worse) assuming everything is okay if it isn’t. 
<br><br>
**Loyalty!** It’s kind of a nice feeling to know that someone is looking out for your best interests and making sure that Future You is a stellar human being. By providing kind feedback from this perspective, the recipient is more inclined to trust you and want to work with you in the future if it helps them improve their skills overall.
