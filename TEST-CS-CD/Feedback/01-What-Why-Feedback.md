# The What and Why of Feedback 

## Objectives: 

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:  

* Articulate why feedback is collected and given
* Understand why feedback is requested and given at Galvanize 
* Identify the four linear types of feedback
* Understand why balanced feedback is helpful
* Balance feedback to encourage growth and development 



## Rationale:

We often ask for feedback, but sometimes, getting useful feedback is like pulling teeth. By understanding why we ask for and give feedback and breaking this down into manageable chunks of feedback types, we get a much better overview of how to provide helpful and useful feedback. 

### Why do we collect feedback?

**From a High-Level, General Perspective**<br>
Feedback is one of the most direct methods we can employ to improve our work, our relationships, and our skills. As humans, we operate under a bias of our own perspective- that is, we base our knowledge upon our own experiences, and we are often not aware of the impact of our actions unless we directly observe it or are made aware of it. 

Feedback makes us aware of the impact that our actions have on other people from their perspective and gives us more insight into how we can improve what we do. 

In non-fancy words: it’s a way to say “Hey, this is how I feel based upon what you have done recently, and this is what I would like to see happen as an outcome of that.” 

**Feedback at Galvanize** <br>
Throughout your experience at Galvanize, we will be checking in with you and asking you for your feedback on a regular basis. 

Why? Much like you, we are iterating and learning each and every day of each and every class, and we’re always looking for ways in which we can do something better. We may also be trying something we haven’t tried before, and while we have a pretty good idea of how it may be working out, we want to know how it’s working out from your perspective. Our goal and expectation is to give you the best educational experience that any student has ever experienced at Galvanize, and iterating on feedback helps us do just that.

We also care about you as humans, so we want to know how you are doing. Is what we’re teaching engaging? Are you challenged enough? Are you overwhelmed? Are you moving at the pace you should be moving? Are you happy about something? Did something we do irritate you or take you away from the learning mindset? We know a lot, but we don’t know everything, and cannot possibly know what you are thinking 100% of the time. Giving us your thoughts gets us inside of your head so that we can understand where you’re coming from and course-correct as necessary without making assumptions about your engagement or comfort level.

On a meta level, we also want you to get comfortable with owning the process of compassionately informing people how their actions directly impact you, even (read: especially) if the feedback is hard to deliver. 

**Receiving Feedback**<br>
Throughout your learning journey at Galvanize and beyond, you will often receive feedback, not just from instructors, but your peers as well. We encourage this process because being on the receiving end of feedback not only helps you improve your performance, but will also help you understand what good feedback “feels” like from an interpersonal and emotional perspective. When you understand this feeling, this can help you gain insight into providing compassionate feedback in the future! We will go into the process of receiving feedback in further detail in a future lesson. 

### The Four Linear Types of Feedback

When we think about delivering feedback, we are often told that we should deliver balanced feedback -a mixture of positive and negative points- in order to keep the recipient feeling engaged and motivated. 

The truth is that when we think of encouraging growth and development, this is only partially right! Instead of two points of feedback, try considering _four_:

**_Negative Feedback_** is corrective feedback about previous behavior. These are things that did not go well or could have been done better. 

**_Positive Feedback_** is affirming comments about previous behavior. These are things that went well and should be repeated again. 

**_Negative Feedforward_**  is corrective feedback about things that did not go well and do not need to be repeated next time. 

**_Positive Feedforward_** is feedback that contains positive comments about future behavior, or things that would be nice to have. These are suggestions that would improve performance in the future. 

It’s important to take stock of what has already happened, sure, but truly robust feedback focuses on what can happen in the _future._ Remember that growth mindset is about iterative improvement and is as much (or more) about focusing on the things that can be changed (feedforward) instead of the things that have already happened and cannot be changed (feedback). 

### Balancing Your Feedback 
When you provide balanced feedback, you engage the recipient and make them feel encouraged to grow instead of making them feel rejected and unmotivated. Here are a few strategies to help you provide balanced feedback: 

**Use all of the types together.** This means that you must understand the differences between each type of feedback and have insights in each area to provide. The challenge with this is to look for specific examples of each type as it relates to the person and try not to make up something generic. 

**Approach from a place of being helpful.**  Remember that you are trying to encourage someone to get better at what they do, not providing a Yelp review. Focus on what is useful, instead of simply pointing out what happened and how it was good or bad. 

**‘And,’ not ‘but.’** As you tie ideas together, remember that the word ‘and’ brings things together and draws people in emotionally. When you use the word ‘but,’ it negates everything that was said before and shuts the person out. If you’ve ever taken an improv class, you are probably familiar with this concept- it helps stories grow instead of shutting them down! 

**Focus on the future.** Remember that growth always happens on a future timeline. In a feedback situation, the past is helpful for context and concrete examples, but should not be used for blame or dwelling on a subject.  Nobody can change what happened in the past, but they _can_ use the examples from the past to influence what they will do at a later date. By focusing on the future when providing feedback, you allow the recipient to prime their brain toward forming an action plan of what to do next and giving themselves ownership of their future self.
