# Implementing Feedback 

## Objectives:
At the end of this lesson, students will be able to: 
<br><br>
* Explain the four elements of the feedback matrix 
* Determine how to act upon feedback based upon reflection
* Articulate the importance of goal-setting when processing feedback
<br><br>
## Rationale: 
Feedback is often delivered with the best of intentions, but it’s one small part of change. Determining how and when to implement feedback is important for your own self-reflection and learning. 
<br><br>
## Implementing Feedback Constructively 
Picture the following feedback scenario: 
<br><br>
**Lydia**: Thanks for meeting with me today. As I mentioned, I wanted to talk about the menu design that you submitted this morning. The quality of the work is great, as usual. I can tell you really took the time to listen to the use cases and you implemented them thoughtfully based upon the input of the client, and I want to recognize you for that. 
<br><br>
**David**: Thank you so much! I’ve been working really hard behind the scenes to make sure that they were happy, so it’s great to hear feedback like that.
<br><br>
**Lydia**: Great- I’m glad to hear that you feel that way. What I’m a little bit concerned about, though, is your communication throughout this part of the project. I and the rest of the team didn’t hear that you were on track to meet this deadline until this morning. We have additional time left before this deliverable is due, so this particular scenario isn’t critical. At the same time, not knowing where you are in terms of progress creates a bottleneck from a project management standpoint, and I’m worried that this could cause issues with future projects if you were to fall behind and we didn’t know about it. What can we do to make the communication across the team more regular in the future? 
<br><br>
**David**: I’m really sorry about that. I was so focused on staying heads down throughout the project that I thought it would be better to deliver well, and deliver early. I tend to turn off my email and my Slack when I’m in heads-down mode because I tend to get easily distracted by unrelated messages and it tends to derail my flow. I’d rather work uninterrupted and deliver early so that I have more time to make iterations if necessary later.  Do you think we can compromise on a dedicated check in time each day so that I can provide project updates and get right back to work with minimal disruption? 
<br><br>
**Lydia**: Thanks so much for being honest with me. This sounds like a reasonable request. Let’s connect with the rest of the team to make sure that this is reasonable to them and to work on finding a time that works for everyone. 
<br><br>
This is a seemingly textbook example of a feedback session that plays out exactly the way that it is supposed to happen. Lydia delivered the feedback, David accepted it and provided some context along with a solution that they both agreed upon. 
<br><br>
While it seems ideal, we also don’t know how well this actually worked out, or if the feedback was implemented. And therein lies the rub: how do you ensure that 1) the feedback is something that is worth acting upon and 2) that the feedback was implemented into practice? 
<br><br>
If you pay attention to this and other feedback sessions, you may observe that people (perhaps even you) do the following: 
<br><br>
* They accept the criticism, but also explain or justify the behavior. 
* They decide that the person giving them the feedback is wrong and dismiss the feedback 
* They focus on the positive part of the feedback and use that to confirm what they already assume and know is true
<br><br>
When this takes place, the feedback often falls short, as nothing comes of the result. Instead of doing necessary self-reflection to determine what needs to be done in order to change their behavior, people continue to keep doing what they were doing previously, and the behavior continues. 
<br><br>
## Enter the (Feedback) Matrix
The Feedback Matrix, shown below, is a tool that can help you with reflection and exploration when faced with feedback. It encourages you to examine both the positive and negative aspects of feedback and connect the comments back to what you already know about yourself, or to examine the things you did not know about yourself that may be worth exploring more. 
<br><br>

<br><br>
Here are the four general qualities as illustrated by the matrix: 
<br><br>
**Positive/Expected:** These are those qualities that you already know a lot about. They’re the bullet points on your resume, the things you like to bring up in job interviews when the hiring manager asks you “What are your strengths?” Even if they come as no surprise to you, that doesn’t mean that you need to ignore this feedback or do nothing about it. Here are some questions that you can ask yourself to best implement this feedback into your productivity: 
<br><br>
“How can I continue using this skill to improve my work even more?” 
“How can I celebrate this aspect of myself?” 
“How can I use this skill to help others who may not be as strong at it?”
<br><br>

**Negative/Expected**
Everyone has those habits that they _know_ are not good for them. Maybe you procrastinate. Maybe you eat too much junk food. Maybe you hit the snooze alarm too much or you ghost on your friends after making dinner plans with them. When you get this feedback from people outside of your own inner thought police, it’s time to re-examine your approach and implement some changes. Ask yourself:
 <br><br>
* “What actions have I already taken to address this issue?” 
* “Are those actions successful? How are they working out?” 
* “What else should I change in order to get the results that I would like about this?” 
* “What are the implications of not making those changes?”
<br><br>

**Positive/Unexpected:** This is like a magical gift from the feedback gods that boosts your self-esteem and lightens your step just a little bit more. You did a thing, you didn’t think too hard about it, and you just got a pat on the back for being -surprise!- awesome. Great! Here’s what you should be asking yourself next: 
<br><br>
* “Why was this a surprise to me?” 
* “How will I celebrate or showcase this skill/ability in the future?” 
* “How can I use this skill to improve other aspects of my life?” 
<br><br>
**Negative/Unexpected:** This is often the feedback that stings the most, as it comes out of left field. It often comes from areas of ourselves that we aren’t prepared to face or don’t want to acknowledge, and that can cause some pretty negative emotions. That being said, if you’ve paid attention to all of our teachings and readings about the growth mindset, you’ll probably recognize that this is the one area that can give you the greatest returns in terms of personal and professional development, if you’re willing to stay open-minded about this feedback. 
Ask yourself: 
<br><br>
“What other information can I obtain to make sense of the feedback?” 
“How will improving this bit improve the other parts of my life and my job?” 
“What steps can I take to put this feedback into practice?” 
“What support might I need in order to deal with the outcome of this feedback?”
<br><br>
One key benefit of using the feedback matrix is clarity. By asking yourself the questions surrounding the different feedback qualities, you’re able to better clarify what this feedback means to you. You’re able to understand how this may affect your life, what actions you may want to take in order to implement it, or how crucial it may or may not be to implement action items resulting from this feedback into practice. 
<br><br>
## Prioritizing Action Items
<br><br>
**Goals**<br>
All of this feedback is great, but is it all super important? Do you need to act upon it? How do you separate the good stuff from the noise? As mentioned in the previous lesson around delivering feedback, goal-oriented feedback is a powerful tool that can help point us toward success. Before you jump on top of every single bit of feedback you receive, it’s a good idea to set goals for yourself so that you can identify and prioritize what is important to you and your own development.
<br><br>
Regular goal setting for yourself can help you clarify what matters to you, what makes you operate at your peak, and gives you an idea of where you want to be in terms of professional or personal development. Much like providing feedback, goal setting should be fairly regular in cadence so that you can adjust as you grow. 
<br><br>
Goals can be quantifiable (“I want to lose 40 pounds by next August”), or general (“I want to be a better communicator”). The idea of setting these goals is to give you a road map and an understanding of what success looks like. That being said, if you are setting a general goal, it’s a good idea to ask yourself additional questions so that you understand exactly what successfully meeting that goal looks like. 
<br><br>
For example, if you want to be a better communicator, you may want decide that you want to improve your descriptive writing skills, or you may want to learn more about conflict resolution. Perhaps you want to get better at public speaking. The more concrete and specific you are about your general goals, the more you can directly relate the feedback you receive to those particular aspects of your life that you want to improve. 
<br><br>
Try to set goals for yourself on a short term, medium term, and long term basis. This will give you a solid idea of where you want to head in life, and will also hold you accountable to quantifiable goals that may be large in scope but easily broken down into manageable chunks. Having a mixture of goals is also, well, just more interesting. 
<br><br>
**Relating Feedback to Your Goals**<br>
After you have received your feedback and placed it within the feedback matrix, start examining each aspect of this feedback as it relates to the goals you (or your teacher, or your manager) have set for yourself. Ask yourself the following: 
<br><br>
“How does this fit in with what I/my boss/my team want for the future?”
“What actions are already propelling me toward this goal, and how does this feedback impact those actions?”
“What are the implications of not following this feedback as it relates to my goals?”
<br><br>
**Prioritizing Action (Or, When It’s Okay to Ignore Feedback)**<br>
At times, you may receive a piece of feedback that, upon mulling over and putting into the feedback matrix, doesn’t coincide with the goals that you have set, or doesn’t fit into a narrative that improves your personal trajectory. That’s okay- humans are flawed creatures, and it’s often possible that the most well-intentioned feedback doesn’t line up or make sense when looking at the big picture. 
<br><br>
Ultimately, you have control over your own actions and can choose which pieces of feedback to implement into daily practice. You can also decide that a certain piece of feedback doesn’t agree with your life plan, or that you simply don’t agree with it. As long as you stay open to the feedback you have received, you have agency to choose how much or how little change you want to make as a result. 
<br><br>
_Note_: If a piece of feedback that you don’t agree with comes out of left field, make sure that you’re not repeatedly hearing the same feedback from multiple sources before you outright dismiss it. People are perceptive- and if you’re hearing the same asks for improvement over and over, it may be worth examining after all.
