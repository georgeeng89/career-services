# Receiving Feedback 

## Objectives:
At the end of this lesson, students will be able to

* Identify the steps to receiving constructive criticism
* Identify how these steps relate to a growth mindset. 

## Rationale: 
Much of our learning relies on recognizing errors and correcting them. In order to improve our work and performance, it’s important to be able to accept criticism with an open mind. 


### Why Criticism is Hard 
I’m sure you’ve been there before: as you’re being told that the work you’ve submitted is less than stellar, you feel your palms sweat and your heart beats a little faster. Maybe your face flushes as your flight-or-fight response kicks in and your blood pressure rises. Before you know it, you’re thinking of an immediate response or a justification of your approach, almost as if you were wired to respond to criticism with a fight. 

It turns out that it may not entirely be your imagination. Behavioral science suggests that our discomfort with criticism is tied directly to the way we psychologically evolved from our hunter-gatherer ancestors. In this social structure, humans’ very survival depended upon inclusion in a tribe, where resources like shelter and food were shared. 

How does this tie into feedback? While being told that we don’t measure up doesn’t always seem life-threatening at first, the underlying message that criticism sends is one of being ostracized- something that would have been life threatening in the hunter-gatherer societies from which we evolved. In a more modern sense, our relationships and sense of belonging are crucial to our ability to earn income and gain social capital- something that could be at risk if we are excluded from our network by way of negative views of our work. 

Adding to this anxious survival instinct, a 1998 study from Ohio State University indicated that electrical activity in the brain spikes more strongly in response to negative stimuli than to positive ones. It’s why doing your taxes may create a sense of dread, whereas perfecting your golf game inspires relaxation. 


### Growth Mindset and Criticism
A significant part of maintaining a growth mindset is overcoming our emotional response to criticism. When we are acquiring a new skill, we will often do things incorrectly, or inefficiently. By accepting input that allows us to course-correct, we do ourselves a favor. We give ourself a very clear opportunity to identify what we need to do in order to improve our work and perform better. 

Sure, that sounds reasonable, but if you’re still wrestling with this concept, imagine that you are trying to paint a house, and you’ve never done it before. You pick up a paintbrush, dip it into the paint, and start what appears to be a very long, very arduous task. After about an hour, your arms start getting tired and your wrist starts to hurt. Suddenly, your supervisor shows up and tells you that you’ll have much better luck and much less splotchy coverage if you use the power sprayer at the base of the ladder. 

Initially, it’s maybe a little uncomfortable to receive this message. You might have felt like a fool for not knowing that there was a much more professional way to do this task. At the same time, by receiving this feedback, you learned that there is something at your disposal to make your job a whole lot easier, and you probably just saved a lot of time in the process. 


### What To Do in the Face of Criticism
Being on the receiving end of constructive criticism can be difficult. Remember, though, that the reason feedback is being given is to help you improve your skills and productivity, not to put you down or judge you. While your emotional response is often the first thing that comes to mind, overcoming this and really listening to the information you are being given will help you identify trends and gain insights about your own growth, not to mention speed up your own learning. 

Taking feedback like a professional can be done via a number of steps: 

1. **Stop your first reaction.** Really, before you do anything as a reaction- stop. By giving yourself an extra second or two, your brain will be given a chance to actually process the situation. In that moment, you can prevent a huff, an eyeroll, or a comeback- and you will be able to remind yourself to stay calm. 

2. **Remember the ways in which feedback is beneficial.** Learning, improving your relationships, performing the way your manager or peers would like you to are all things that contribute to your success and make you a better future you. This is a good thing, even if it feels uncomfortable. 

3. **Listen actively and repeat to clarify.** As the person shares their feedback with you, listen closely and make eye contact. When they are finished speaking, repeat what you’ve heard back to them in order to confirm understanding. For example, “I hear that in the future, you would like me to wear black shoes with a black belt instead of wearing brown shoes with a black belt. Is that right?” 

By repeating back what you’ve heard and asking for confirmation, you are showing respect for the person providing the feedback to you and demonstrating that you value the time they have invested in doing so by giving them your full attention. You also eliminate the possibility of confusion or miscommunication by ensuring that you understood them correctly, and offering them a chance to clarify their words if you have indeed misheard them. 

At this point, focus on understanding this person’s perspective, not analyzing or questioning their motives. Also try to give the benefit of the doubt to the person on the delivering end. Sometimes giving feedback is difficult, and the person giving it to you may be nervous or may not express their ideas perfectly. 

4. **Say “Thank you.”** This is the hard part, but look the person in the eyes and thank them for taking the time to share their thoughts with you. Be deliberate about this- it takes effort and sometimes courage for someone to do this. Remember that saying thanks does not mean that you agree with their assessment- it just means that you acknowledge and appreciate the effort they put into sharing their opinion. 

5. **Deconstruct and clarify.** This is the time to start processing and interpreting the feedback. You may want to share your perspective, or get some clarity around the ideas being shared. Try not to debate or argue. Rather, ask questions to uncover the root of the issues that are being raised, and identify possible solutions. 

For example, if your pairing partner told you that they thought you were not engaged during your session, you could do the following to unpack this feedback: 


* Try to obtain specific examples of the behavior in question: “I may have been distracted, but can you share more information about what you saw that made me appear to not be engaged?” 
* Identify whether this was an isolated issue or something that is ongoing: “Is this the first time you’ve noticed this, or was I doing it when working with you before?” 


If you want to share perspective, there are a few ways to do this in a productive manner: 

* Acknowledge and own the feedback that you agree wtih: “You’re right that I was looking at my phone early on in the session. I’m sorry about that.” 
* Look for solutions to address the feedback if they have not already been provided: “I’d love your ideas on what I could do to handle this differently in the future.”


Once you have gained common ground on the issues that have been raised and have decided next steps going forward, you can probably end the conversation and move on. However, if it’s a larger issue, you may want to request time to follow up with the deliverer of the feedback in order to ask more questions and gain alignment on what to do next. This will also allow you to process the feedback, seek advice from other people, or think about solutions.  

Remember, constructive criticism is an efficient way that we learn about our weaknesses from others. Without it, we don’t improve, and when we are defensive about it, we risk missing out on important insight and an opportunity to level up our thinking.
