## Rationale

### Your Work Style is a Part of Your Story

In the previous lessons, you have spent time reflecting on your story and what makes you YOU. You’ve thought about your journey from your previous education and career into web development or data science, and have spent some time diving into your motivations. These are important elements of a personal introduction that allow you to talk compellingly about yourself. 

You also bring unique value to the table through your personality and work style - these are other important elements of your story. However, it may be difficult to pinpoint exactly what your strongest traits are, and how you add value to a team.

This immersive program is designed to allow students to learn at an accelerated rate. You will encounter several roadblocks along the way--as a result, you will likely feel uncomfortable at various points in the program. This is all part of the experience here at Galvanize. Your ability to employ growth mindset, and overcome discomfort and challenges, is part of the learning experience. Employers repeatedly tell us this is an important hiring metric, as it has been identified as one of may criteria for job/career success.

Since developing this kind of self-awareness is so important, you will be doing a work styles assessment during the Friday breakout session to help you start to think about how you add value, and what your challenges moving forward may be.

### Why are you giving me a work style assessment?

Employers place a high value on self-awareness. Your ability to clearly articulate your strengths during interviews, informational interviews, and while networking is crucial. Galvanize places a high level of importance on self awareness, as it is necessary to learn, level up, and become an even better employee. The assessment will help you:

* Know where you excel, and where you need to improve
* Arm yourself with more information that will enable you to talk about your strengths during interviews, networking, etc
* Be aware of how you operate
* Be aware of how others operate (high EQ, emotional intelligence), as to potentially accommodate other’s work styles to be more productive
* Create an environment in which we are all aware of how we prefer to work, and be able to identify when we get out of our comfort zone

This assessment is a tool that will enable you to be more self aware, be a better teammate, and a better employee.

### This is NOT a test!

View assessments as a way to take inventory of your personality traits and preferences. An assessment differs from a test, as there are no right or wrong answers! 

Personality traits are in indicator of who you are and how you operate. There is no judgement of your outcomes, only increased awareness. When taking the assessment, **it is important that you don’t overthink the answers to your questions.** 

Answer according to your first, or your gut instincts. Answer that question and move onto the next one. Once completed, you will have a chance to find the results of your assessment, learn more about what the results mean, and learn how your preferences may affect how you work with others.

### Assessments

Assessments can be enlightening and useful tools to improve your awareness of your personality, characteristics, and how you interact and work with others. An assessment almost always follows a similar process: answer several questions, “scoring” the assessment, and a follow up interpretation of your assessment results. 

Perhaps you have taken an assessment in the past either through school, or as part of a work exercise. More common assessments include Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), Strengths Finder, Strong Interest Inventory, Career Leader, SkillScan, etc. Each assessment is slightly different, and focuses on different outcomes. For example, Career Leader is an assessment focused on how your specific personality traits are related to common areas of leadership--for this reason, it is commonly used in undergraduate and graduate business programs. Strong Interest Inventory, as the name implies, focuses on your interest, and is commonly used with students 18-22 years old to help identify potential career paths. 

The Assessment that you will take will focus on your work style preferences: you will learn how your personality traits influence how you PREFER to work. Each assessment has a designed focus, and the applications have pros and cons. All personality assessments have direct roots to personality theories, which have all been studied by psychologists such as Freud (psychoanalysis), Maslow (humanist), Skinner (behavioral), and Bem (gender roles). 

### Personality Traits 

Personality Traits are simply defined as patterns of how you think, how you feel, how you interpret outside stimuli, and how you make decisions. You may share personality traits with other people, but the accumulation of your entire set of personality traits makeup YOUR personality...what makes you, YOU.

Your personality is organized and consistent--under normal circumstances you operate based on your preferences. For the most part, your personality is stable, but it can be influenced by your environment. Events, stressors, emergencies may influence how you might ordinarily operate. For example, if you have ever witnessed a colleague behave differently under pressure, or you hear of people “snapping” under pressure. These are examples of how you might operate outside of your preferred set of operational “guidelines” or “modus operandi”. 

It is also important to note that personality causes behavior--you react to situations based on your own internal set of guidelines. Your choices and decisions are all affected by your personality. 

Thought Experiment: Can you think of a time when you “acted out of character”? What was the situation, how did you act out of character? What happened, what was the outcome, and were there adverse consequences? Did your behavior affect other people?

### Work Style Assessment

Work style assessments focus on how your personality traits influence how you work. This includes how you prefer to approach problems, work alone, work with others, and identifying your work environment preferences.
