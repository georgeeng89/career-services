In this Harvard Business Review article (https://hbr.org/2005/01/whats-your-story), Ibarra and Lineback note that you should “reframe your past in light of the change you’re seeking to make.”

This doesn’t mean that you should lie about your past - but recognize that there is always more than one way to talk about your past experience and how you’ve ended up where you are now.

To do this, reverse-engineer your story. The ending is that you become a successful data scientist or software engineer working in industry. 

### What past experiences were the triggers that brought you here?

What parts of your education or work experiences can contribute to this story? It doesn’t matter if these were minor in the grand scheme of things - *they are important in this version of your story.*

### What elements of your personal life can contribute to this story?

Even if these ideas from your professional, personal, and educational life are from long ago, you should include them. In fact, they are almost *more* valuable that way! It helps to show continuity, and that this particular plot twist in your story has been a long time coming, as opposed to being the result of a rash decision (something hiring managers are rarely fond of!). 

On the flip side, what areas of your past are not relevant - what should you minimize when you tell you story?

**Be the agent of change**

We all have things happen that are out of our control - whether it’s a job loss, death in the family, illness, etc. Many times, these kinds of circumstances are part of the story that brings us to where we are today.

However, when you relate these kinds of events, make sure to focus on *your action as a result of these setbacks*, as opposed to presenting yourself as the passive recipient of a series of events. 

Consider the following two tellings of the same event. Which one do you prefer? Why?
<br>
<br>
**Story 1**

I started working at KikStix right after college and I wanted to get into programming at that point - I had the chance to do so there. But then they got acquired pretty quickly by Cisco, and in the reorganization I ended up on a QA team. I stuck with it anyway because my wife was still in school and it was pretty much the only job in that town. Last year, Cisco had a bunch of layoffs, and I was one of the people laid off. So I started applying to a bunch of companies, but nobody would even interview me. That’s why I came to Galvanize - I’m hoping to have better luck after this program.

**Story 2**

I started working at KikStix after college and initially was on the programming team - it was something that had always intrigued me even though I had limited experience. When we got acquired by Cisco I got reorganized to the QA team. This was a fascinating learning experience for me - I got this high-level appreciation of the whole software development process, and a really good understanding of the kind of standard a product needs to be at in order to ship. I also got my hands dirty with various aspects of testing and writing some source code. When Cisco had layoffs last year, I took that as an opportunity to step back and evaluate what I wanted to do next. I realized that my experience kept pointing me back in the direction of that original interest of actually being on the software development team. So I’ve come to Galvanize to level up my skill sets with the latest tools being used in web development.

### Consider what makes you unique 

Your life experiences have made you who you are - and are soon going to make you a unique contribution to the data science or software development industry. In the following exercise, spend some time reflecting on what your motivations are, and what has brought you to where you are today. These ideas are going to be important in telling your story, and in answering questions that people ask you about yourself.

You can also take online assessments of some of your natural strengths and personality - these are also a big part of how you add value. 

A great free online strengths test can be found here: https://www.kent.ac.uk/careers/Choosing/strengths.htm

After taking the test, take some time to read about what your results mean. How have those strengths affected your journey, and were they at all responsible for bringing you here to Galvanize? How will they affect you here, and in your future journey?

### Your story can - and will - change 

Keep in mind that it’s ok if your story changes - in fact, it’s likely to! Your story will change depending on the context in which you’re telling it (interview? networking situation? to a new friend?) and depending on who your audience is.
