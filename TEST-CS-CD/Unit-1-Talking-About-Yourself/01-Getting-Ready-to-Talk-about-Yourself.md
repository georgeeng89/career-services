# Getting Ready to Talk about Yourself

## Lesson Objectives:
By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
* Explain what’s important to focus on in a brief personal introduction
* Explain the optimal timing of an introduction

## Rationale:

Throughout this course, and going into your job search, you are going to have many opportunities to tell your story. It’s important to understand what will make you stand out - in both a positive and negative way - when you talk about yourself. 

### The Personal Introduction

Let’s start off with some statistics that might seem a bit scary —

You make a first impression within 7 seconds of meeting someone. That first impression is a mix of content and confidence.
The approximate breakdown is that the first impression will be based 7% on our words, or what we say, and 93% on non-verbal cues and communication.

Also, you can talk for about 30 seconds before you lose someone’s interest.

Introducing yourself in a compelling way is going to be one of the most important and portable tools in your job search toolkit. Networking can happen at any moment, and so you should always be prepared. A solid introduction gives you complete control over how you are delivering your brand, and piques the interest of your audience.

*Fact:* “Tell me about yourself” - or some close variation on that - is going to be one of the things you get asked most frequently over the next 6 months, and into your job search. Now that you have spent some time reflecting on your unique personal story, it's time to practice incorporating it into an introduction that will leave your audience wanting more.

### Timing

Take a good look at that 3rd stat provided above - studies have shown that after about 30 seconds of talking, you’ve lost your audience’s interest. This is probably when you’ll notice their eyes glaze over, and they are starting to think about how they can get out of this conversation. 

When you are introducing yourself, therefore, you will want to focus on the most relevant and compelling content for how you are selling yourself - and get to it quickly.

### Focus

Now imagine that you are a hiring manager at a networking event looking to hire software talent. You introduce yourself to someone, and ask him to tell you about himself. He starts off, “I was born in Los Angeles…”, and then talks about his childhood, education, and hobbies. Do you think you will want to pursue this person to make a hire?

When you are introducing yourself, it’s important to have a *focus that suits your audience.* In a networking situation, interview, or anything else that’s related to your career, you will want to *focus your introduction on ONLY the aspects that show you in the best professional light.*

Also, remember the timing advice given above - you don’t need to tell your whole life story, or even your whole professional story. The aim is to simply pique your audience’s interest, and leave room for them to ask follow-up questions and start a conversation. Therefore in this initial pitch, you don’t need to include where you are from, what your nationality is, or anything about your childhood -- UNLESS it’s somehow relevant to your web development story.

Instead, you will want to focus on what makes you professionally unique, including aspects such as:

  * Interesting information from your professional or educational background, that now informs your career in web development
  
  * Your motivations for making a career change (Note: this is one of the most compelling, and memorable, things you have to talk about!)
  
  * Your skill set, and how you have used your skills
  
  * Your interest areas and passions within technology
  
  * What you would like to do in the future

In the following lessons, you will learn how to put these elements together in a personal introduction.
