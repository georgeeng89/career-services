## Lesson Objective:
By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
  * Describe your individual learning experience at Galvanize, in a way that emphasizes skills and qualities that employers look for.

<br>
## Rationale:

People, and, most notably, employers, will ask students to tell them about Galvanize; students need to have a clear, accurate answer so that they communicate their education in a way that is understood by the listener and gives credibility to the student’s experience.

It’s important to know how to talk about Galvanize in the way that best markets you as a highly-employable software engineer or data scientist. 

<br>

### How You Should NOT Describe Galvanize

Let’s start with the things that you should avoid saying when you talk about Galvanize. 
<br>
<br>
**Bootcamp**

This is one of the most frequently-used terms to describe Galvanize, but if you use it, you’re potentially doing an injustice to your educational experience. There are a lot of technical bootcamps flooding the market, and they come in a range of qualities and levels of rigor. Many students graduate from web development bootcamps and are barely able to create an app; others have little knowledge of computer science, or the basic skills that are needed to participate productively on a development team. Similarly, many data science bootcamps barely move beyond data analytics. It’s gotten bad enough that in the more saturated markets, such as San Francisco, *some employers have explicitly started saying that they do not hire bootcamp grads.*

Instead, refer to Galvanize as an **“immersive program.”** This term better describes the holistic nature of Galvanize’s web development and data science programs and the level of dedication that students here need to have in order to succeed. You should follow this with a description of the duration of the course, what you learned, and how. 
<br>
<br>
**Co-working space**

Other people only know Galvanize as a co-working space. When they visit our campus, they don’t even see the classrooms, or the hard work that students are putting in! If you hear someone refer to Galvanize in this way, use it as an opportunity to enlighten them about the great educational programs that are at the core of what Galvanize does. If you help Galvanize become well-known as an educational powerhouse, you will give more credence to your own technical brand.
<br>
<br>
**Events space**

Some people have interacted with Galvanize because they have come here for industry events. If you hear someone refer to Galvanize as an events space, you should once again take the opportunity to talk about Galvanize’s educational programs, and how they are unique precisely *because* Galvanize brings the whole technical industry together as part of the learning process. Not only did you take part in an immersive course, you also got great industry exposure through the many events held on campus.

### Elements to Focus On

When you find yourself talking about Galvanize, whether at a networking event, or during an interview, there are some elements you should focus on that will emphasize the quality of the program, give you credibility, and help make you stand apart from boot camp graduates. 
<br>
<br>
**Technologies Learned & Iterative Curriculum**

Galvanize has a curriculum development team that is constantly testing the market to find the latest technical trends in our different campus locations, and creating curriculum so that our students are learning the most cutting-edge technologies. 

What is taught is re-evaluated before the start of every new cohort, and the content is changed to make it as relevant as possible to the tech industry as it is right now. 
<br>
<br>
**Rigorous Admission Process and Timeline**

While Galvanize believes in creating an environment for anyone with the smarts, drive, and grit to succeed, there is a rigorous application process in order to be admitted into the program. Students often have spent several months or years teaching themselves programming prior to even starting the course, and some have taken boot camp courses or prep courses prior to coming to Galvanize. 

For the Web Development Immersive, students must have a solid knowledge of HTML, CSS, and Javascript before starting the program.

For the Data Science Immersive, students must know SQL and Python before being admitted, and must also have strong knowledge of linear algebra, probability and statistics. Many students (but not all!) come from STEM backgrounds or have worked in analytical roles. 

Additionally, the Galvanize Web Development Immersive is a 6 month program (compared to 3 months at most boot camps). This timeline allows students to absorb knowledge more fully, work on more interesting and complex projects, and learn fundamentals of computer science (something that’s very important to most employers). 
<br>
<br>
**Project-based curriculum**

Galvanize has a project-based curriculum, so students are learning by building practical projects. Students get to experience working on the front end and back end of apps, and are responsible for building applications from the ground up. At times, students also work on apps that have been partially built by other students, to get the experience of working with existing code bases.

<br>
<br>
**Computer Science**

One of the top complaints hiring managers have about boot camp graduates is that they don’t know computer science. Galvanize’s Web Development Immersive dedicates a full quarter to computer science fundamentals, covering topics such as Big O notation, quicksort, binary search trees, hash tables, Djikstra's algorithm, and more.
<br>
<br>
**Company Partnerships**

A perk of having the tech industry on campus with you is that you get to interact with startups and other companies, and sometimes collaborate with them. Whether it’s through an individual project, or a full-class collaboration with a partner company, having this kind of industry exposure is unique and will make you stand out.
<br>
<br>
**Learning to Learn**

You may not be surprised to learn that most software engineers and data scientists are hired to work with stacks and technologies that are at least partially unknown to them. One of the most important qualities of a high-performing software engineer or data scientist is the ability to learn something quickly and independently. 

Galvanize focuses on a mentality of learning to learn as a key takeaway of the program so that students will be prepared for this aspect of their future careers. The curriculum is modeled so that instructors gradually release responsibility to the students, who take control of their own learning. It’s not unusual for Galvanize students to independently learn new technologies, languages, or frameworks for their projects - with no hand-holding from instructors. 
<br>
<br>
**Pair Programming, Teamwork, and Agile Methodology**

Galvanize also teaches the softer skills that are just as essential as the hard skills when it comes to being a successful software engineer or data scientist. Students regularly pair program on assignments. Students collaborate through group projects, and learn how to fairly distribute work, be accountable to a team, collaborate with one another, and work together to solve challenging problems. 

For group projects, our students learn the basics of agile methodology, which is another very desirable skill set at the moment.
