# Understanding the Messages your Body Language Sends

## Lesson Objective:
By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
* Understand what constitutes good body language and how it affects how you are perceived

## Rationale:

A large percentage of the first impression is based on *what you do,* not what you say. It's important to understand the messages your body language is sending, and how you can control them, so that your audience can focus on the content of your verbal message and story without distraction.

### Body Language

Imagine you have just met someone, and are trying to start a conversation with her - but she has her arms crossed and doesn’t shake your hand, is looking in another direction or down at the floor, and is slouching. How would you feel about her confidence level? Would you feel comfortable continuing the conversation?

Body language is an important part of communication, and it can be as intentional or unintentional as spoken words. You may not be surprised to hear that most people are unaware of their body language as they as working, standing around not talking to people, or even when they are actively engaged in conversation. You will need to work towards being more conscious of your body language so that you can make sure you are sending out the correct messages!

The following are some important areas to focus on in body language. As you practice your personal introductions (in the next lesson), try practicing out loud in front of a mirror. Pay attention to your body as you speak. What can you do to make yourself look more confident?

**Smile**

Unsurprisingly, a smile is an important part of your body language. When you smile, you’re showing people that you are happy and open to engagement. Furthermore, people tend to smile when they talk about something they are passionate or excited about. You’ll seem more interested in what you are saying (and in the conversation in general) if you smile!

Take some time to practice smiling while you talk, and also smiling with your eyes in addition to your mouth. A smile that ends at the mouth will often come across as insincere.

**Make eye contact and physically show engagement**

When you’re talking to someone, you should maintain eye contact, taking just short breaks away during a pause, while laughing, or quickly while thinking. Strong eye contact makes you seem more approachable and engaging, and makes people feel more connected to you. When you’re smiling with your eyes at the same time, you will create a sense of intimacy and friendship.

For some people, this is a delicate balance - you also don’t want to stare at someone TOO HARD. Make sure you are blinking a normal amount, and that your eyes are not too wide open. To practice this, find a friend, family member (or your Career Services Manager!) whose opinion you can trust, and ask them to review your eye contact.

Other ways of showing engagement are by using hand gestures while you are talking (palm-up hand gestures are received best - keep the gestures below chin level to keep them from being distracting), and nodding while the other person is talking.

**Have good posture and use power poses**

For good posture, keep your back straight, your shoulders back, and your chin up. Distribute your weight evenly on both legs. Practice some superhero poses in the mirror - they might make you feel silly, but also powerful. What do you notice? Superhero poses take up space, and create a sense of strength in the body - both of these things are the opposite to what you do when you feel insecure (body folded in, taking up as little space as possible). Though you won’t use actual superhero poses when you are networking, you will want to display that same confidence. 

For more on power poses, see Amy Cuddy’s video, “Your body language may change who you are”, in the Unit Resource section.

**Pay attention to your arms, hands, and feet**

Some positions clearly show discomfort, and they should be avoided. Don’t put all your pressure on one leg when you stand. Avoid tapping your foot or fingers, fidgeting, or rubbing your fingers together - these are nervous habits that the person you’re speaking to will most likely pick up on a subconscious level, and will feel uneasy about. Crossing your arms in front of you, or behind your back, shows a lack of willingness to engage.

Instead, keep your arms relaxed at your side, or use hand gestures when you talk. Distribute your weight evenly on both feet, and eliminate unnecessary extra movement.

**Strong hand shake**

Allen Pease, professor of psychology, has a couple basic rules for a great handshake: 1) shake hands with a straight hand, and  2) give as much pressure as you receive. A limp handshake shows a lack of confidence. Avoid visibly touching your hair, face, or wiping your hand on your clothes before shaking someone’s hand. 
<br>
<br>
**Mirroring** 

By loosely mirroring the body language of the person you are talking to, you can build rapport and a sense of comfort. For example, if they are sitting with crossed legs, do the same.
<br>
<br>
**Touching**

Refrain from touching different parts of your body - such as your face, lips, hair, legs, etc., excessively. Many people have physical coping mechanisms to deal with stress - such as twirling hair around a finger. It’s distracting to your audience and makes you look less confident in yourself.

**Fake it ‘til you make it**

Our natural body language tends to reflect how we are feeling. Unfortunately, networking and meeting new people tends to make almost everyone feel awkward. If you’re feeling this way, it’s important to try to “fake it ‘til you make it”. Pretend you are acting the part of someone who is you, but confident. If you keep at it, eventually you will start to actually feel confident.

As you practice these body language techniques, remember that it is NORMAL for this to feel awkward at first - in fact, it does for most people! - and that that’s ok. You are going to work on this throughout the course to get used to these techniques and interactions as quickly as possible, and start making them work positively for you!
