Sample answer: The basic introduction will most likely be used as soon as you meet someone, as a brief introduction to who you are. The “origin story” will be used if someone asks you to tell them about yourself, or in a networking situation where you need to give some more information. The full background story is most useful in a more formal setting, such as a meetup or presentation, where you are asked to tell more of your story.
