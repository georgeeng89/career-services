# Growth vs. Fixed Mindset 

## Objectives:
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to: 
* Explain the concept of neuroplasticity 
* Identify the behaviors of people with a growth mindset vs. those with a fixed mindset 
* Identify benefits of a growth vs. fixed mindset
* Identify fixed mindset behaviors and reframe them into growth mindset ones

## Rationale:

Throughout this course (and as you learn new things in general), you will be making many new neural connections, and this can be a confusing and frustrating process. Maintaining the proper mindset will allow you to learn efficiently, and enjoy the process of learning and working at an accelerated rate. 

### Neuroplasticity

Neuroplasticity is the concept that our brains are not hardwired at birth, but are instead changeable over time, based upon the way in which we use them. 

If you think of your brain as a city map, and your tasks as destinations, the way in which you perform those tasks creates roads (or neural pathways) within that map. The more frequently those pathways are used, the stronger the connections get - much like a highway being built in order to take more people from the outside of a city to the shopping mall at the center of town. However, learning a new habit, or thinking of something differently, creates an alternate path- much like taking the surface streets to get to the mall when the highway is jammed, or going to a friend’s house instead. 

All of our behaviors physically reorganize our brain as we learn them. This happens in three interconnected ways: 

• Chemically/electrically between neurons. This happens very rapidly, and supports short term learning. Chemical changes are temporary in nature, which is why we don’t always remember 100% of what we do after the very first time we do it.    

• Structurally changing the connections between neurons in order to operate more efficiently when those particular neurons have a lot of interconnectivity. This takes more time than chemical changes, as it only happens with repeated connection between neurons. This is how long term memory is created. 

• Functionally As you use a region or network of a brain, it becomes more excitable, making it easier to use again. As these regions get more and more excitable, your brain shifts how and when those regions are used. 

What this means is that every time we think a thought, or act on a habit, we travel a particular pathway in our brain related to it. The more frequently we take this same pathway, the more well-traveled that pathway becomes, and the more likely we are to use that same pathway again. 

When we change a habit or learn new skills, we create new pathways in our brain. Over time and repetition of these behaviors, the new pathways strengthen. If we do not continue our old habits (or we stop practicing our old skills), the previously well-traveled pathways weaken over time, and we forget how to perform the things that we have not done recently. 

The concept of neuroplasticity is a fairly recent one- in fact, scientists largely believed that brain development was static at adulthood until the 1970’s. However, in 1999, researchers at the Salk Institute in San Diego, CA discovered neurons reproducing in adult humans, including a 72-year old adult. 

Now that you understand the biology of learning, it may be helpful to understand the psychology of learning in order to maximize your learning ability. 


## Fixed Mindset vs. Growth Mindset
 
There are two types of mindsets that we can have as we learn: one that thinks of problems as opportunities to learn, and another that avoids problems out of fear of failure. People who avoid these problems are viewed as having a fixed mindset. Those who view problems as a chance to think differently about their process are viewed as having a growth mindset. 

People with a fixed mindset believe that talent and intelligence are fixed qualities that are determined at a young age or at birth, and that these qualities are critical to their success. Often, people with a fixed mindset will operate under the belief that if they “prove” their ability, this will lead to respect and success in life. They will often document past achievements, and will hesitate to do anything that will challenge the perception of themselves appearing smart or talented. These folks often feel that when it comes to talent, people either have “got it” or “not.”

People with a growth mindset view skills and intelligence as things that can be developed with time and effort, and often view new ways of thinking as exciting. Because people with a growth mindset operate with the understanding that they can do anything as long as they work toward it enough, the process of learning becomes less about proving their intelligence and more about the idea of simply getting better at what they do. Growth mindset people view the brain as a muscle, and support the concept of neuroplasticity. 

## How Praise May Impact Your Mindset (and Performance) 

Psychologist Carol Dweck studied the effects of praise on the mindsets and related performance of children. To do this, she administered an IQ test to 400 fifth graders across the USA. Upon completion of this test, students were praised in one of two ways: 

• For their intelligence, as in, “Wow, great job- you must be very smart!”<br> 
• For their effort, as in, “Great job- you must have worked very hard for this!” 

Dweck then offered all students the opportunity to either take a second, harder test that would be an opportunity to learn, or a test that was at a similar skill level to the first and would be easily passed. 67% of the “smart” group chose the easier option, but 92% of the “hard-working” group chose the harder test. 

In other words, children praised for being smart (fixed mindset) were more likely to want to continue to appear smart, whereas people praised for working hard (growth mindset) were overwhelmingly likely to want to continue to push themselves further. 

A third, much more difficult test was administered to the students. The fixed mindset group grew frustrated and gave up early. The growth mindset group worked longer, harder and appeared to enjoy the test by comparison. When faced with a final test that was as easy as the very first test administered, the fixed mindset students did worse than they did on the first test, with average scores decreasing 20%. The growth mindset scores increased by 30%.

Depending on how you may have been previously praised at school or work, you may have developed a growth or a fixed mindset. However, it’s feasible to make the shift between the two with effort. (In other words, it’s possible to have a growth mindset about having a growth mindset!) 

### Thought Patterns of Fixed vs. Growth Mindset

Our mindset can radically impact the way in which we perceive not only challenges, but the way in which we develop our working habits. Take a look at the following examples: 

#### Feedback
People with a fixed mindset can view feedback as a judgement of themselves, and will often take constructive criticism personally. They may fear receiving feedback about their performance as it may make them look stupid or less skilled. 

People with a growth mindset recognize that constructive criticism has nothing to do with them as a person, but is about the quality of their particular work. It is through this feedback that they learn how to increase their skill level and ultimately get better at what they do. 

#### Stress and failure 
People with a fixed mindset may quit a project as being too challenging without giving themselves a proper chance to work through the challenge and solve the problem. They may often avoid taking on new projects out of fear of failing. They often view failure as a character flaw instead of an opportunity to learn, and fail to recognize that ability comes after repeated failed attempts at success. Learning is stressful, frustrating, and tiring.  

People with a growth mindset view failure as an opportunity to try a new tactic, and take comfort in knowing that they are closer to success by process of elimination! They often seek out new challenges and opportunities and do not concern themselves with the appearance of looking dumb if they are not immediately successful. They are motivated by their own learning instead, and view learning as fun, inspirational, and an investment in themselves.


Overall, greater happiness and success will be enjoyed by people learning with a growth mindset.

### What Does Growth Mindset Sound Like? 

It’s possible that our words will reveal which mindset we’re operating with! Below are some common fixed mindset phrases (and their growth mindset counterparts).
