# Becoming a Better Learner |  Play 

## Objectives:

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to: 
* Describe the concept of play as it relates to learning 
* Identify and explain the three steps of play 
* Identify the benefits of growth mindset as it applies to play

## Rationale:

In order to stay motivated through learning and work, you need to ensure that you are engaged and rewarded as you go about solving problems. Playing makes learning fun! 

### Play

Before any of us spent days in a lecture hall, we likely spent time as children playing with blocks or on a playground, and it was there that we probably discovered a lot about ourselves and our universe!  

Children learn at a much faster rate than adults, and research suggests that playtime has a big part of that. It makes sense when you think about this- children have a different attitude toward learning and discovery than most adults do, and this comes from the constant movement, touch, smelling, and trying new things that kids do in the pursuit of discovery. When was the last time you fell off of the monkey bars and learned about gravity? 

Like setting the stage, this particular aspect of learning has three steps as well: 


1. Wrestle With Information 
2. Take Risks 
3. Have Fun

### Wrestle With Information 
The amazing thing about reality is that there is nothing static about the information we are given. We live in a dynamic world full of dimension and nuance- so it’s no surprise that when we are faced with a problem that there are often multiple ways to approach it. Wrestling with information allows us to see a problem from all angles instead of accepting only one possibility or approach. 

Take a look at an object near you without touching it, and think about what you know based upon the angle from which you’re viewing it. What do you know about this object? What are the assumptions you make about this object? How well do you know this object? 

Now, pick up the object and look at it from a different angle. Rotate it a little. Look at the bottom of it, or inside of it. Rub your fingers on it. Smell it. If it’s sanitary, taste it! Does it move? Is it squishy? Does it make noise? 

What has changed about your understanding of this object? 

When we look at an object or a problem from only one angle, we have very limited scope of information about it, which makes it difficult for us to fully grasp our understanding of or build fluency with it. When we dive in and wrestle with it, we learn a lot more about it and are likely able to make more sense of it. 

This should be the goal of everything you learn in general. In order to develop true understanding of the concepts tossed your way, allowing yourself to be exposed to something just once will never be enough. It’s often tempting to blow through topics and concepts in an effort to keep moving forward, but much like process over product, developing the habit of focused development and repeated accessing of information will help you remember what you’re touching- and will allow you to see it from multiple perspectives. 

### Take Risks
Let’s talk playground shop again. 

I remember the time I truly learned about the impact of gravity, balance, and time management when I was a kid. I was at the top of the slide behind a long line of children, and I saw a coveted spot on the swingset open up from across the yard. 

I wanted down then and there.  

I knew that if I waited much longer to take the comfortable route down, I was likely to miss out on pumping my legs and defying gravity over and over. So, I glanced down, got a good idea of how high up I was, took aim, and jumped about seven feet straight down into gravel. 

I learned three things that day: <br>
<br>
• Gravel hurt my ankles a lot when I planted my feet squarely on it from high above.<br>
• It would probably hurt less if I jumped from a little lower and bent my knees as I landed.<br>
• I could make it across the playground in a space of five seconds- enough time to scooch into that seat before anyone else- making my shortcut risk totally worth it.<br>
<br>
Was this a smart risk? Debateable. Was it a worthwhile risk to my six year old brain? Absolutely. Did I learn how to fly down from the slide each and every time a spot opened without a scratch or a bruise? Eventually, and I was thrilled with this reward. 

When it comes to learning and risk taking, it’s the effort and not necessarily the intelligence that makes the biggest difference to your outcome. Remember how we talked about growth mindset? This is a concept that directly aligns with the research that supports it. 

Taking risks -be they in terms of information, new processes, or jumping from seemingly precarious heights - is a key part of growth, and is often not easy. But the reward for persistence and a little bit of fear is that you will be able to learn more and grow every single day. 

### Have Fun! 
Lastly, remember that learning should be fun even if it’s a little scary or frustrating at times. If you find your jaw clenched and the vein in your forehead is throbbing while you take risks and wrestle with information, then you’re not having fun, are you? If you’re not having fun, you’re not playing. 

Having fun isn’t always about being comfortable, either. Remember, that a supportive learning environment and a growth mindset is based upon an acceptance and an understanding that you will make mistakes. You will fail, big and often. Taking risks can be a scary thing, and if you’re afraid to show vulnerability or to make mistakes, this can cause the outer cortex of your brain to shut down, putting you into flight or fight mode. When our outer cortex is shut down, the part that makes us the most human and allows us to think critically is down and we're not in an optimal state for receiving information. 

When you find yourself not having fun, it’s time to take a break and do a quick reset. Go for a walk, take a deep breath, step outside, and do whatever you need to do in order to regain your focus on why you are here to learn.
