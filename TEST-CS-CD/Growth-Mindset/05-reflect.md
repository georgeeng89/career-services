# Becoming a Better Learner |  Reflect 

## Objectives:

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to: 
* Identify the steps of reflection 
* Explain the benefits of using reflection for learning 
* Identify the questions that will help you get the most high value for your learning 

## Rationale: 

As you’ve learned in the previous lessons, repetition and revisitation of old material is an important part of forming long-term memory. Reflection helps you remember the things that you have learned and will help you better articulate your learnings to yourself and others . 

### Reflect
The third and final step to becoming a better learner is to reflect on your learning. 

After you have cleared your stage of distractions, primed your mind for fresh ideas by clarifying what you are learning and why you’re doing it, and given yourself time to grapple with new concepts, reflection allows you to think about what happened and where you go from here, solidifying your learning. By revisiting these lessons learned, we help our neurons strengthen the pathways we have just created in our brain, and we are much more likely to retain our newly-gained information the next day. 


Like setting the stage and play, the reflect process is made up of three sub-steps:<br>
1. Self assess<br> 
2. Ask new questions<br> 
3. Repeat<br> 

### Self Assess
Ask yourself the following questions:<br><br> 
• What were my objectives? <br>
• How far did I get? <br>
• How much is left?<br> 
• How well did I set the stage?<br> 
• How well did I play?<br> 
• What can I do better next time?<br><br>  

Thinking about your own thought processes and providing yourself with honest feedback is one of the best gifts you can give yourself in terms of developing self-awareness around your learning. By performing this step after each learning session, you will be able to multiply your ability to learn. 

### Ask new questions
The second part of reflection is to ask yourself new questions about the information you just learned. In doing this, you are able to identify what you already know, what you still don’t know, and what you want to prioritize learning next. 

Forming these questions also forces you to again activate the center of your brain that you’ve just engaged, and will provide you with the motivation to solve new problems and keep learning. Have you ever uncovered a juicy question that you couldn’t wait to solve? 

Sometimes we have difficulty asking new questions of ourselves when we’ve just spent a period of time unpacking a new concept. If this happens to you, remember that you can always fire up this questioning process by asking yourself, “How could I best make more use of this information?”

Write down your questions! In performing this step, you can always go back and review them in the future. Even if you don’t get to a point where you solve these questions, you can use this history as a barometer of your learning progress. The next time you are facing imposter syndrome, look back on these questions- you’ll often discover that you have learned and grown tremendously based upon the questions you were previously asking yourself. 

### Repeat 
The final step of reflection is to repeat this cycle, and repeat it often. As mentioned previously, repetition is one of the most sure-fire ways to commit short term memories into long term ones, and dedicating cycles to this process will get you in the habit of investing additional time into your own efficiency. 

The best part of this process is that the more your practice it, the easier and faster you will retain new information- your newly restructured brain will thank you!
