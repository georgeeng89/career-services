# Imposter Syndrome and Dunning-Kruger

## Objectives: 

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to: 
* Identify and define imposter syndrome  
* Define the Dunning-Kruger Effect 

## Rationale
During the process of learning, it’s easy for us to get caught up in what we do not know about our abilities. Identifying these two blocks to your learning will help you become more self aware. 	

While learning, it is important to maintain an objective awareness of your skill level. One of the ways in which you can accomplish this is via frequent reflection, which we will cover in a later chapter. However, despite our best intent, it’s feasible that we may fall prey to the following issues, both which fall under the umbrella of illusions of confidence. 


### Imposter Syndrome 
Imposter syndrome is the inability of people to recognize their accomplishments, leading them to underestimate their abilities. People experiencing imposter syndrome may often feel that their intelligence and accomplishments are attributed to luck instead of their own hard work, and may also make up for these feelings by overcompensation in the workplace, such as staying late at work, or not setting boundaries around their work-life balance. Often, people who experience imposter syndrome view themselves as a fraud, and live in perpetual fear of being exposed as incompetent, unintelligent, or lazy. 

Ironically, imposter syndrome usually affects people who are fairly high achieving. For many people, imposter syndrome is a symptom of gaining skills and expertise- that is, it isn’t until significant learning has happened that people realize just how much more they have to learn on a given subject, leading them to believe that they do not have much of the skills that they should be given credit for. 


While imposter syndrome is common among everyone, it is more likely to be experienced by women. Many experts have theorized that this is due to the so-called “ambition gap” -meaning that despite their education and accomplishments, women have internalized messages about their lack of qualification, leading them to believe that they are not qualified for the recognition that they deserve. 

### Symptoms of imposter syndrome
Imposter syndrome can look differently for everyone, but commonly shows up in the form of perfectionism, overworking, fear of failure, pushing away praise, or viewing achievements as luck. 
Even wildly successful professionals experience imposter syndrome. Maya Angelou once stated, “I have written 11 books, but each time I think, 'Uh oh, they're going to find out now. I've run a game on everybody, and they're going to find me out.” 

### How to Overcome Imposter Syndrome
It’s important and often helpful to recognize that imposter syndrome is a common thing, especially among people pushing themselves toward success. If you find yourself second-guessing your hard work, take an inventory of the things that you have accomplished up until the point at which you are now in your career, learning, or life path- odds are that your accomplishments when laid out will add up to a story other than luck.

Comparing yourself to others is also a surefire way to make imposter syndrome rear its ugly head. If you find yourself looking at the accomplishments of your peers and thinking that you’re a fraud by comparison, remember that you’re only privy to your own inner monologue and that all of the doubts and errors you’ve been ruminating on are not likely to be noticed by people outside of yourself- just like you don’t see everyone else’s inner turmoil day to day. 

### Dunning-Kruger
In 1999, Cornell psychologist David Dunning and graduate student Justin Kruger set out to test a theory behind a frustrating personality quirk they had observed in the field. Their theory? That while nearly everyone holds a favorable view of their abilities in social or intellectual domains, it’s possible that some people may overestimate their ability and assess themselves as being more knowledgeable than they actually are. When faced with proof of their incapability, their incompetence prevents them from being able to recognize that they are not as skilled as they think they are. 

To test this theory, Dunning and Kruger asked undergraduate students a series of questions around grammar, logic and jokes, and also asked each student to estimate their overall score and rank compared to the other students in the experiment. Students who scored the lowest always overestimated how well they did- in fact, the students performing in the lowest 25% of the test gave themselves a self assessment of being better that two-thirds of the other students. 

Ask any person to rate themselves as a driver, and they will likely tell you that they are a good one. In fact, 80% of drivers surveyed in a 1986 study rated themselves as an above average driver- something statistically impossible! 

### Dunning-Kruger in Real Life
So what is wrong with a little extra confidence? People experiencing Dunning-Kruger are often less likely to recognize the opportunity for improvement and growth when given constructive criticism, which can hinder their overall progress and make them increasingly frustrating to work with. 

Additionally, without being aware of what good work looks like, people experiencing Dunning-Kruger may end up settling for mediocrity or incompetence without giving themselves an opportunity to increase their knowledge and ability. 

The Dunning-Kruger effect can also hurt you when it comes to your job search. Take this interview strategy that outs Dunning-Kruger, pulled from an Ars Technica message board: 

“I learned a very valuable interviewing trick as part of [my company’s hiring] method.

Get some idea of where the candidate actually is technically by talking to them (i.e. don't just believe the resume, actually interview them technically.) Then as one of those 'dreaded' questions at the end of an interview, as them to rank themselves on their primary skillset in terms of 1-10, 1 = bad, 10 = good.

This wasn't 100% but you could see some very predictive trends:

2-4 = an experienced, senior person who realizes that while they know a lot, they underrate their skill.
4-7 = either a moderately experienced person (average candidate) or a truly expert, brilliant individual who should rate a 9 or 10.
8-10 = n00b, with little experience other than ‘I touched it once, three years ago.’ In other words, they know enough to overrate themselves.

Nobody ever gave themselves a one. I get a lot better information from this, instead of [a] ‘what are your greatest strengths and weaknesses’ type question.”

Think you might be experiencing Dunning-Kruger? It’s important to remember that as you begin your learning in any new subject that you will continually be exposed to what you do not know- it’s only until you’ve embarked fully on a learning path that you will realize how much you have left to learn, and identifying where you are in that journey will be integral to your overall success.
