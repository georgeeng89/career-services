# Becoming a Better Learner |  Setting the Stage 

## Objectives:

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to: 
* Describe why becoming a better learner is important 
* Identify the three steps to become a better learner 
* Identify the three steps to setting the stage 
* Explain why setting the stage is important 

## Rationale:

Learning at an accelerated rate is a skill that is developed over time, and is crucial to ongoing success. Priming your brain to accept new information in an efficient manner will help you retain new information faster, and will encourage you stay motivated in your learning journey. 

### Why is Becoming a Better Learner Important?

In technology, methods and skills rapidly change, so being able to keep up with these changes and remain efficient is an important ability that will make you successful long term. If you went through a traditional school, you may have grown accustomed to passive learning- that is, you were probably used to sitting through lectures that delivered information to you, and at the end of the school year, you may have ultimately remembered some of this information, but it was unlikely that you would immediately be able to implement your knowledge and skills into work. Ever have the feeling of leaving a lecture and having no idea how to start a project using the knowledge you just gained? 

The goal of a program like this one is to empower you with the critical thinking and habits necessary to implement knowledge into work right away. With this method, you will be much more prepared to learn, adapt and iterate quickly- and this will be helpful as you level up your skill set. This set of habits will also help you continue to learn and grow long after finishing this course. 

### The Three Steps of Becoming a Better Learner 

In order to prime our brains for success and help us retain knowledge over time, there are three stages to learning that are encouraged in repeated succession:  

1. Set the stage 
2. Play
3. Reflect 

### Setting the Stage 
In terms of learning, your brain can be compared to a living room that needs to be painted. 
Think about the process of painting a room. Before you can get the paint on the walls, there is likely a bit of preparation that needs to happen, such as moving furniture, washing the walls,  setting down tarps, taping off woodwork that shouldn’t get paint all over it, etc.. You also may need to know what tools you plan to use, how many ladders you will need, even how many gallons of paint will be needed! Without this planning and preparation, you may end up with dribbles on the furniture, partially coated walls, and a sloppy mess in general. 

Your brain is very much the same way- without making sure that you know what needs to go in there and how to get it in there cleanly, you will likely end up not retaining information as well as you could be, and you may wind up with fragments of skill building in there. 

Setting the stage consists of three steps: 

1. Clear the Stage 
2. Clarify the What and the Why 
3. Prioritize Process over Product

### Clear the Stage 
Much like a computer, our brains have a limited amount of short term working memory at our disposal. Therefore, in order to maximize our learning and critical thinking, it’s important to clear the stage of distractions that may take our focus away from what we should be prioritizing as we learn. In other words, if you have a bunch of junk in your head, now is the time to get it out of there and start fresh! 

If you haven’t gotten in the habit of doing so already, give yourself five minutes at the beginning of your day to write down any lingering to-do items, thoughts, or other things that may take your focus away from the main task at hand. Grocery shopping, remembering your Aunt Matilda’s birthday, writing that thank you letter to your friend- all of these should go into a safe to-do list that you can access later so that they won’t bother you while you’re putting new information in your brain. 

Another important aspect of clearing the stage is getting rid of all notifications and distractions. Close out any non-relevant tabs, disable Facebook notifications (or Facebook altogether), silence and put your phone away, etc.. Research shows that we are only capable of holding about four chunks of information (for example, new concepts) at a time. Any of these distractions takes up slots of your memory and limits your ability to absorb new information. 

If you haven’t done so already, please take a moment to remove all distractions and turn off all notifications that are around you now. You’ll feel so much clarity without the memes, promise. 


### Clarify the What and the Why 
In order to have a clear path and focus in learning, it’s important to understand both what you wish to accomplish and why. 
The what is your learning objective or goal. This is whatever you are trying to achieve when you are setting out to learn. You’ll notice at the beginning of each lesson that these goals are explicitly laid out for you; however, when you are learning on your own, it is important for you to come up with your own objective to clarify what you wish to accomplish at the end of your learning session. 

The why is your meaning and motivation behind what you are learning. As humans, we’re driven by purpose and the ability to align our tasks with an ongoing narrative. Therefore, if you can frame something you are about to do so that it motivates you, your brain will be more likely to retain the information presented. No matter what topic you are learning, it is a good idea to understand why the topic is important, how it will help you, or how it fits into the bigger picture overall. (You’ll also notice this at the top of each lesson under the heading Rationale)

### Prioritize Process over Product 
This last part of setting the stage is important, and it may go against your instincts if you are used to placing pressure on yourself to meet certain deliverables by a due date. Prioritizing process over product means that you dedicate your focus and effort toward the process of learning, and you ensure that you are performing deliberate and solid focus, and developing solid work habits along the way- even if your work is initially full of mistakes or you don’t fully understand the concepts that you are learning on the first try. 

This work may be difficult, and you may not reach your end goal each day that you set out to do your work. This is okay, as long as you are continually challenging yourself to grow just outside of your comfort zone, or in the zone of proximal development.

The reason good learners prioritize process over product is that truly solid work comes after repeated practice and failed attempts. All of these add up to additional perspective around the why of our learning. When we flip the switch and prioritize product over process, we are more inclined to take shortcuts, cheat, and completely miss out on why we are learning something in the first place. This may benefit us in the short term, but will do us a disservice in the end. 
If you have a hard time relating to this concept, try this: imagine that you are tasked with building a house within the space of either 5 years (including training and apprenticeship) or the space of a week. You have absolutely zero knowledge about zoning laws, electricity, construction or architecture. 

If you take the latter option, you may have a house in a week- if it was prefabricated, mold-injected, and arriving on a truck. If you built this house, it would be very unlikely that it would be up to code, safe, or a pleasant place to live. 

If you take the period of five years and invest in the training and discipline needed to learn what goes into construction, electrical work, zoning, and the like, you will have much more autonomy and agency to have not just a roof over your head, but a sturdy one with the architectural details you like, and in a decent location with beautiful lighting and wonderful landscaping. Plus you will have a much greater sense of accomplishment in knowing that you put in effort toward something that you truly were able to make your own. 

Process will guide you long after you have built any product, and it’s a skill that translates to future products!
