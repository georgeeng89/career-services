# Targeting Companies

## Objectives: 
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
 - Explain the importance of setting an intention or target before starting a job search
 - Explain the job search intent funnel: industries, geographies, functional roles
 - Identify the industries, geographies, and functional roles that you’d like to target during your job search

## Rationale: 

 - Culture fit matters to employers; employers favor candidates who are excited about their company and share their company’s values, goals, and practices. Therefore, if you apply to companies that you’re excited about, you will be a stronger candidate (and a happier employee, should you get the job).
 - It’s possible to gather A LOT of information about a company—via networking, a company’s website, Glassdoor, Google searches—and determine if a company meets your desired criteria before you apply.  
 - When interviewing, companies will ask you, “Why do you want to work here?” or “What do you know about our company?” By researching the company beforehand, you will be able to answer these questions well.

### Introduction: Why Company Research Matters

You never walk out of the front door of your apartment/condo/house without an intended destination. A purpose or intent drove you to leave, otherwise we would have a lot of aimless individuals wandering the streets of our respective cities. Starting a job search is the same; you need intention and direction, so as to keep your job search on track and your job activities working towards a singular goal. Not only will this save you time and energy, it will also make you a stronger candidate among the companies that you pursue. 

Culture fit is important to employers and is taken into consideration when making hiring decisions. Unsurprisingly, companies want to hire people who are excited about their company and share their company’s values, goals, and practices. If you take the time to research the company and understand what is important to the organization, you have a better chance of finding a genuine connection and targeting companies that meet your desired criteria and be more engaged as an employee. 

### How to Focus Your Job Search

**Component 1: Industry**

* General
  * What products/services does the employer provide? 
  * What industry trends are affecting the company? 
  * How many employees does the employer have? 
  * What jobs does the company typically hire for? 
  * Where is the employer located? 
  * Does it have more than one location?
  * How long have they been in business?
  * What are the employer's mission and values? 
  * Is the employer involved in community services? If so, what? 
* Financial:
  * What is the employer's financial situation? Is it making money? 
  * Has it downsized in the last five years? 
* Reputation:
  * Has there been any recent important news related to the company?
  * What do others think about the company? 
  * What's it really like to work for this employer? (Use sites like Glassdoor and talk to current or former employees.)

**Component 2: Geography**

Another important question to answer when determining what job search criteria matters to you is where you want to work. Will you only consider positions in the city where you’re living, or are you willing to commute or even relocate? If so, what are your boundaries? 

**Component 3: Functional Role**

Functional roles are defined by the organizational structure of a company. Departments in an organization perform functions or duties for the company, such as accounting, marketing and production. Individual employees perform a functional role for the company within those departments. The employees are members of a team who work together to further the goals of the organization using their particular skills and talents. Within each department, or function, there might be multiple positions, depending on the size of the business. Understanding the various functional roles in the workplace will help you plan your career path. Businesses create departments to handle specific activities, relying on professionals trained in those disciplines to handle that work. Common business functions include accounting or finance, administration, human resources, production management, logistics, information technology, sales, advertising, promotions and public relations. 

Some functions separate related activities, with multiple functions under an umbrella department. For example, a marketing department might include sub-functions such as advertising, promotions and public relations. The information technology department might be split into a group that works on servers, systems and computers, and another that works on the company website and e-commerce.

### As You Research…

Organization is key to completing a thorough job search. As you research, take notes to refer back to during your job search. For example, you may read about an award the company won that you could ask about in an interview. Keeping your research organized will also help you in taking the next step. You will want to do research each time you are applying for a role. When you have target companies in mind, there are a variety of ways you can then take action including:
* Look for contacts in your network with a connection to the company and/or job posting.
* Find events such as Meet-Ups where a representative of the organization will be.
* Follow the organization on social media such as LinkedIn, Twitter, and Facebook.

### Track Your Activity

A job search is a job in and of itself. After spending weeks networking and building your own brand within your new function and industry, you meet a lot of new people. You’re in contact with multiple companies and different people at each of those companies. You apply. You interview. You follow up. You complete take homes. In short, there are a lot of balls in the air, often at the same time. 

You are already using your Career Development Tracker to keep tabs on your networking contacts as you progress through this program. After the next lesson, you will also use it to start tracking companies that you are interested in.
