# Job Application Context

## Objectives: 
By the end of this lesson, students should be able to:
 - Explain what employers look for, what a typical job search looks like, and how to apply for a job

## Rationale: 
- Soon, you will start applying for jobs. It’s important to understand how the job search process works so you can best prepare for it. 

### What are employers looking for?

Soon you will start applying to jobs to launch your new career as a data scientist or web developer. As you may be aware, searching for a job is not an easy process. You should be prepared for it to take a lot of time - and effort. You’ll improve your chances of landing a job quickly if you understand what employers are looking for.

When we ask our hiring partners what they like to see in candidates, we tend to hear the same four things over and over again:

* **Technical Skills.** This should come as no surprise - if you are hiring a software engineer, you want someone who knows how to code. Since many hiring managers come from traditional educational backgrounds, they may be less open-minded about educational diversity. You should be ready to challenge the perception that graduates from bootcamps and immersive programs aren’t competent technical professionals. How can you do this? Practice telling people about the intensity of your program, the topics you covered, and the knowledge and skill base you were developing before you even came into the program. Emphasize the hands-on, project-based curriculum, and accomplishments like your projects, case studies, and capstones. If someone is giving you hard pushback - tell them that you would be happy to show your skills through a coding challenge or take home. 

* **Experience.** This is one that is particularly tricky for people who are changing careers. You will have to think about how your previous education and experience has prepared you for your next role, as well as how the work you’ve done at Galvanize has given you the kind of real-world data science or web dev experience you will need to be successful.

* **Passion (and other soft skills).** Some people are surprised to learn that companies put just as much focus on soft skills as they do technical skills - and sometimes even more! We have had hiring partners that are willing to overlook technical knowledge gaps in candidates, as long as they have things that are harder to teach - like interest in the company, the ability to work well on a team, etc. Always try to show the passion you have for what you’re doing - passion for data science or web development, and passion to keep learning, and passion for the company’s mission, or product, or technology….

* **Culture fit.** This is the trickiest one. There tends to be two kind of “culture fit”. Many companies are very proud of their company cultures, and will publish company values on their web sites. Part of the interview process will often be trying to see how you fit in with those values, and seeing if you will be a good fit on their team according to that. Always try to be aware of the values and culture a company is promoting, and be ready to talk (with specific examples!) about how the culture resonates with you. The second kind of culture fit is the subconscious kind. Many studies have shown that at the end of the day, we hire people we like, and we hire people who remind us of ourselves. So the self-taught engineer is more likely to hire another self-taught engineer, and the data scientist with a PhD is more likely to think that all data scientists must have PhDs. This kind of hiring bias is one of the reasons that there is such a lack of diversity in the tech industry. However, since you know it exists, try to use it to your advantage as much as possible. Always be friendly, and try to show how you connect with the people you’re talking to (do you both volunteer for the same cause? Did you go to the same school? Do you come from the same hometown?).

### What does the interview process look like?

The typical interview process varies a little between data science and web development. We will be going through all these parts of the interview process in much more detail in Unit 9, as well as how to prepare for the different parts of an interview. Here is what we tend to see:

In data science…

* The first round is usually a **phone screen** with a recruiter or hiring manager, depending on the size of the company. This will usually cover: 1) “Tell me about yourself” - be ready to deliver your pitch, tailored to the company and role! 2) Why you got into data science and how your previous experience led you here. 3) What skills you have that are relevant. 4) “Tell me about your project” - be ready to talk about your case studies and capstone. 5) Why this company and role? 6) Some soft skills questions. 7) Opportunity to learn more about the company, role, and interview process.

* The next round often consists of a **Take Home Challenge.** These vary in length by company - sometimes you are expected to take your time and spend about a week on the assignment; other times, you will be given a strict time deadline (like 4 hours). 

* The third round often is a **Technical Phone Screen.** This will usually be with a hiring manager, who is a data scientist or software engineer, and will typically last between 30 minutes and an hour. This most commonly consists of a live coding challenge, while explaining your thought process to the hiring manager.

* The final round is an **Onsite Interview,** which will vary a lot from company to company. Sometimes and onsite interview is as short as 2 hours, and other times, they will last all day (9 am  - 5 pm). You should expect to meet your hiring manager and some future teammates, as well as a sampling of other people in the company (if a smaller company, it’s not uncommon to meet the CEO or similarly senior person). The onsite is typically a mix of soft skills questions, talk about the company and role, pair programming challenges, whiteboarding challenges, and questions that test your general technical knowledge.

In web development…

* The first round is usually a **phone screen** with a recruiter or hiring manager, depending on the size of the company. This will usually cover: 1) “Tell me about yourself” - be ready to deliver your pitch, tailored to the company and role! 2) Why you got into web development and how your previous experience led you here. 3) What skills you have that are relevant (remember to talk about the computer science curriculum!). 4) “Tell me about your project” - be ready to talk about your projects and capstone. 5) Why this company and role? 6) Some soft skills questions. 7) Opportunity to learn more about the company, role, and interview process.

* Frequently, the next round will be an **Online Coding Challenge.** These vary in length. To practice for these, look at the challenges on web sites like HackerRank (https://www.hackerrank.com/) and CodeFights (https://codefights.com/). According to one of HackerRank’s own studies, programmers who complete at least 20 coding challenges on their site for practice end up performing about twice as well in interview coding challenges. 

* Rarely, a company will also give a **Take Home Challenge.** This will be a more project-based, in-depth coding challenge - occasionally as involved as building out an app.

* The next round often is a **Technical Phone Screen.** This will usually be with a hiring manager, or a software engineer, and will typically last between 30 minutes and an hour. This most commonly consists of a live coding challenge, while explaining your thought process to the hiring manager.

* The final round is an **Onsite Interview,** which will vary a lot from company to company. Sometimes and onsite interview is as short as 2 hours, and other times, they will last all day (9 am  - 5 pm). You should expect to meet your hiring manager and some future teammates, as well as a sampling of other people in the company (if a smaller company, it’s not uncommon to meet the CEO or similarly senior person). The onsite is typically a mix of soft skills questions, talk about the company and role, pair programming challenges, whiteboarding challenges, and questions that test your general technical knowledge.

The typical interview process takes 4 - 6 weeks from first contact. Small startups tend to have the fastest interview processes, and can sometimes go from initial contact to offer in 1 - 2 weeks. Large companies tend to have the slowest interview processes, and the most flexibility in their interviewing timelines. 

For example, if you are interviewing for a general software engineer or data science position at a company like Google or Facebook, where they are planning to hire several people to that role throughout the year, the typical process can take a couple months. You will also have more flexibility to push back interviews to accommodate a busy schedule at these kinds of companies - if you need to wait a month before the onsite, for example, that’s usually ok. Finally, these companies also tend to be the most flexible at the offer stage, and can often push back deadlines to accept or reject an offer.

Therefore, if you are trying to time your interview process so that you receive multiple offers around the same time (which is the most ideal situation!), apply to larger companies as early as possible, even if you then delay the interview process to match other timelines. 


### What does a Galvanize job search look like?

A job search can depend on a lot of factors - from how much time you put into your applications and networking, to things that are totally out of your control, such as the time of year. 

(Did you know that seasons affect the job search? One of the busiest hiring times of year is in January, at the start of Q1, because companies receive new hiring budgets and head counts for the year. You’ll notice similar patterns at the start of Q2 (April) and Q3 (July), and that hiring will slow down a little at the end of every quarter (March, June, and September). Q4 hiring varies by company - many companies are already wrapping up hiring for the year by October, while for others, October is a big hiring month. For most companies, hiring starts to drastically slow down from mid-November through the end of the year. The companies that hire most during this period tend to be small startups that are desperate for help; the companies that hire least during this time tend to be larger corporations that have a very structured recruiting organization. However, this is still a great time to be applying to jobs and to be networking like crazy! The people who get hired first during the January hiring rush tend to be the people who started talking to companies - either through networking or through an application - during the end-of-year period.)

We recommend that students start applying to jobs early - usually around break week for data science, and at the start of Q4 for web development, to give yourself a good chance of building momentum in the job search prior to graduation. Though the typical interview process takes 4 - 6 weeks from first contact to offer, there can be several weeks between submitting an application and getting contacted for the first interview. Additionally, we regularly see that students who build job search momentum during the course land jobs the quickest after the course ends.

Because of this, we recommend that you do not take any break or vacation after the completion of your program. Having a break between your program end and starting your job search - for any reason - is strongly correlated with being on the job market for a longer period of time. 

There are many things that may contribute to this: 1) The loss of momentum; 2) You can quickly start to forget the technical skills that you learned, and will need to take even more time to recover them; 3) Your attractiveness as a candidate will start to drop, and therefore it is more difficult to find a job.

More on that last point: A strange truth about the recruiting world is that the most desirable candidate is one who is currently otherwise occupied (in a job, in school, etc.). Furthermore, many companies don’t like to see a gap on the resume for any reason (though some gaps are totally normal - you should talk to your Career Services Manager to discuss how to talk about your employment gaps if you have them). Especially in tough job markets, employers can be stricter about this. Additionally, in tougher markets, such as San Francisco, employers may judge graduates of boot camps and immersive programs more harshly. These kinds of programs have been around long enough that employers know some very smart and talented people come through them - but a stereotype has also formed that the best graduates get snatched up quickly. After you have a gap of a few months on your resume following an immersive program, employers will be more likely to believe that you are an undesirable candidate. 

When you start applying to jobs, you will - unsurprisingly - get the best conversion rate from warm applications (applying to companies where you know someone who can refer you, or where you previously had an informational interview, or where you interacted with someone at a networking event or meetup). About half our students tend to get jobs from their networks.

However, the other half tend to get jobs off the back of cold applications. Cold applications have a relatively low conversion rate, and therefore you will need to be applying in high volumes to get results. For example, in San Francisco, we tend to see that students need to apply to an average of 100 jobs to get one offer. (And that’s an average - so keep in mind that for some students, it will be much higher!)

Since everyone wants to have more than one offer, you can imagine that you will need to apply to a LOT of roles. 

We recommend the following cadence when you are in the job search:

 - Send 50 cold applications per week
 - Aim for 3 warm applications per week
 - Attend at least 2 networking events per week
 - Spend the rest of your time continuing to develop your technical skills, practicing for interviews, and working on projects. (If someone at an interview asks you what you’re up to right now, it’s good to be able to tell them about a current project you have going!)

As you are applying to jobs, track your metrics. For example, how many cold applications do you need before you get a first round interview? How many warm applications? How many first round interviews convert to technical screens? How many technical screens to onsites? Onsites to offers?

If you have this information, your Career Services Manager will better be able to help you pinpoint the different parts of the interview process where you are struggling, and can give you targeted advice for how to improve.
