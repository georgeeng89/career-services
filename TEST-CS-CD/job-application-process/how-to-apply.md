# How to apply to jobs

As we just covered, the best way to apply to a job is through a warm introduction or referral. However, the reality is that this won’t always be an option. When you need to send a cold application, do the following to maximize your chances of success:

* Apply through the web site or 3rd party site, and always include a cover letter unless you are expressly asked not to. This is important because it gets you into the company’s applicant tracking system.

* However, many applications that go into an ATS are never seen by human eyes. After you apply, reach out to a couple people on LinkedIn and try to find someone who would be good for an informational interview. If you connect on LinkedIn, you can send a message something along the lines of, “Hi (name)! I saw that (Company) is looking to hire (role) and I just applied through the web site. I’d love to learn more about what you all are up to on the data science team. Are you free for a quick phone call or to grab a coffee? I’d really appreciate it!”
  * You will often find you get higher response from this kind of request because you have already applied, and you are NOT asking for a referral, which makes some people uncomfortable.

* LinkedIn is good, but email is even better. Try to find the hiring manager on LinkedIn, and see if you can get his or her email address from their profile. Send the hiring manager a brief cover letter introducing yourself, saying why you are interested in the role and the company, and that you would love to discuss the position in more detail. Attach your resume.

* Don’t fear if you can’t find the email address! Most companies are fairly predictable and will use one of the following:
  * firstname.lastname@company.com
  * firstname@company.com
  * firstinitial.lastname@company.com
  * firstinitiallastname@company.com
  * You can also use web sites like emailmatcher.com to try to find someone’s email address.

* In your email, say that you will follow up, and the set calendar reminders to actually do so. For example, end your email to the hiring manager with: “I’ll follow up on Thursday next week to see if there are any questions about my background that I can answer for you.” Always follow up! Remember that most people don’t follow up, and that by doing so you will be putting yourself at a huge advantage. 

* Once your applications convert into interviews, always ask questions about what the interview process looks like, what the interview timeline is, and when you should expect to hear about next steps. One of the most difficult parts of interviewing is not knowing what happens next - and there is no reason to feel this way. In your initial recruiter screen, ask about how quickly they are looking to hire, and what the next step is. The recruiter should also be able to tell you specifically when you will hear back about if you are going to the next step or not. This also gives you permission to follow up if you don’t hear back. For example, if the recruiter tells you they will know by Monday if you are going through, and you haven’t heard, you can send a follow-up email on Tuesday asking about next steps.

* Make sure that you always follow up after EVERY interview, even the phone screens, to EVERY person you talked to. Make sure that throughout the interview process you collect the contact information of everyone you will need to send a follow-up email to. A follow-up email should thank the interviewer for their time (or the recruiter for arranging the interview), should mention something specific that you talked about during the interview (this helps personalize the note), and should re-state your enthusiasm for the role and for moving on to the next steps. This is also your opportunity, if you feel you answered a question inadequately during the interview, to clarify yourself or give a different response. For example:

Hi Anna,

Thanks again for taking the time to talk with me today - I really enjoyed hearing more about DoorDash’s team and the problems the data science team is working on right now! I especially appreciated hearing about your experience working on the mapping algorithms, as that’s an area of particular interest to me - and similar to a problem I worked on in my Capstone project (link). 

As you may have noticed, I was a bit nervous during the interview, and I know that I didn’t find the best solution to the second coding challenge you gave. I’ve taken another look at it and re-worked it - my solution is attached below. 

I’m very excited about the data science team, and am very keen to hear about next steps! Please let me know if there’s any other information that I can get to you.

Looking forward to hearing from you soon,

George


### Top Tips for the Application Process

* Don’t apply to too many jobs at the same company. In many ways, this is a waste of your time - and can actually make you look like a worse applicant. If a recruiter receives 5 or 10 applications from the same person, they are likely to think that you don’t know what you want, or - worse - that you’re desperate. Limit yourself to one application for small to medium-sized companies, and 2 or 3 applications at the large companies, but only if the applications are for roles that are in different enough departments that they are likely to go to different recruiters. If you are interested in more than one role at a company, or if you are unsure which role is the best fit, it’s best to discuss this with the recruiter once you get them on the phone.

* Recognize that many job postings aren’t real - or are intentionally generic. One of the reasons that cold applications can take so long to get results is that many of the jobs posted online are either fake or out of date. Sometimes companies post jobs - or never take down old job postings - to make it look like they are growing more quickly than they actually are (or they are just lazy!). Sometimes recruiters post fake jobs just to build up their candidate pipelines, so they have people ready and waiting when the actual jobs do start coming in. Finally, some large companies post loads of generic-sounding jobs that are difficult to distinguish between because they want to cast a wide net. These companies tend to have a generalist interview process, and once you’re in the process, they will start to talk to you more about the specific roles and teams where they have openings. 

* Schedule your interviews quickly. Except for at the largest companies that are filling loads of similar jobs, you should always schedule your interviews as quickly as possible. Most companies that have specific hiring needs will offer the job to the first candidate they meet who is qualified - as long as they also like them and can negotiate reasonable terms. Even if you are already in the pipeline, you may find a company will offer the job to someone else who is further along in the process, so always try to be quick!

* Disclose conflicts of interest ahead of time. If, for example, you uncle works at the company you’re applying to, even if it’s in a totally different department - make sure your recruiter knows about it from the first phone call. This kind of thing will not disqualify you as long as everyone is aware of it, and can plan a fair hiring process around it. However, if they only realize it late in the process, or at offer stage, they will be more likely to be worried about continuing the process, thinking it could have been unfair, or could lead to a lawsuit.

* Do NOT answer: “What other companies are you interviewing with?” You will usually get asked this early on in the interviewing process by both third-party and in-house recruiters, but for very different reasons. Either way, it’s best to avoid answering. Third-party recruiters tend to ask this question for their own business development purposes. For example, if you mention to them that you are also talking to Minted and Pandora about front end engineer roles, the recruiter now knows that those companies are hiring - and the recruiter will have several other candidates who fit that profile. They can now get in touch with those companies, market their candidates, and increase your competition for the roles. In-house recruiters ask this for a very different reason: they know that the hiring process is messy and is rarely predictive of a good hire, and they are hoping to get signal from other companies as to how good you really are. Let’s say you mention to that Facebook recruiter that you’re also interviewing with Google. You can be certain that the Facebook recruiter will continue to follow up with you on how the Google process is going. If you eventually get rejected (as most people do), the Facebook recruiter will know that Google found something they missed. Therefore, when asked these questions, avoid answering, and be vague: “I’m in process with several other companies, some larger public companies, as well as some mid-size startups. But I’d much rather talk about this role - can you tell me more about the projects the data science team is working on?”

* Do NOT answer: “What is your desired salary?” “What is your salary history?” This is another question that you are likely to be asked in the first phone screen with the recruiter. To put yourself in the best position to negotiate later on, you should avoid answering this question. (NOTE: As of 2018, in California, employers will no longer be allowed to ask you what your salary history is, and they will be required to provide a salary range for the role if you ask for one. However, they CAN still ask you what salary you want.) If you’re asked about this, deflect, or turn the question back on the recruiter: “I’m really focused right now on finding something that is a great fit, both where I’m going to be able to make a big impact and help grow a company, and where I’m going to be able to learn a lot. Let’s revisit salary later once we both know that this is a great match.” “I’d actually like to learn more about the role and get a better understanding about the full scope of it before we talk specific numbers. Salary is just one part of the overall package for me, and I need to know more before I can make an informed decision.” “I’d love to know how Postmates thinks about compensation! What does salary and the compensation package typically look like for you guys for a role like this?”

* Use recruiters to your advantage - if you can! Most third-party, or agency, recruiters will not work with people who have come out of bootcamps or immersive programs unless they have significant prior experience in the field. Keep in mind that their clients, the hiring companies, are charged a fee that usually amounts to $20 - 40,000 for anyone they provide who gets hired! However, if you ARE able to get a recruiter to work with you, they can be invaluable for your job search. Recruiters will know what jobs are on the market that aren’t being advertised, and will also be able to give you insider information about the company and what they are looking for, and will therefore be able to help you prep for your interviews. Some recruiters also handle the negotiations for their candidates, which can spare you a stressful interaction. If they do so, they are highly motivated to get you the best deal possible, since their fee is calculated as a percentage of your compensation.
