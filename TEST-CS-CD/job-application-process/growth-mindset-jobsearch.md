##### !explanation

If you find you currently gravitate toward a fixed mindset, challenge yourself to look at your job search through a positive lense. You are the master of your search! The world is your oyster. 

If you find you gravitate toward more of a growth mindset - keep it up! 

Most students find they are somewhere in the middle. The goal is to create mental patterns and habits which help you cultivate an optimistic outlook and positive growth mindset as you journey through your career.

### The relationship between goal orientation and search outcomes.
A 2014 study found in Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes (journal) found a relationship between Goal Orientation and job search outcomes. It states:

What does this mean? In short, people who are goal oriented (thereby demonstrating a growth mindset), are self aware, and are more likely to regain employment, when compared to those who did not receive goal orientation training. Your mindset drives your behavior, which drives your job search outcomes.  If you want to tweak your results, you need to start with your mindset. Much like Charlie Reeveâ€™s onion, it starts with your understanding of yourself.

When you interview, you may be asked questions about your strengths, weaknesses, work style, motivation, etc. If you lack self awareness in these areas, it will be challenging to answer these types of interview questions. Be sure to go into your interviews with a clear sense of self. There are a variety of tools available to help you raise your self awareness. Please complete the following assessments, and submit your results below.

When you interview, you may be asked to reflect upon your strengths and weaknesses, as they relate to the role you want. For example, a detail-oriented role may not be a great fit for someone who does not mind the details. Moreover, a role that requires strategic thinking may be best suited for someone who can easily see the big picture. You need to articulate how your strengths and experiences align with your desired role, while minimizing the impact your weaknesses may have on your future performance.

#### LOCUS OF CONTROL
The locus of control scale is a measure of one's attribution style. (Attribution style is a person's way of attributing things they experience in every day life). Imagine a spectrum, in which external and internal are in opposite ends. 

![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-4BS-ihH4m0s/Ubm1FtukO0I/AAAAAAAACK4/J-b0jUjfpzU/s1600/Image.jpg)

Where you fall on this spectrum identifies if you feel like you're in control of what happens to you, versus feeling like things happen to you outside of your control. People who believe they are in control are more aligned with a growth mindset.

## Part 3: Looking at your career over time
_"Perfect is the enemy of good."_ - Voltaire
So you have acquired some outstanding technical skills, and you are ready for work. Do you search for your perfect, dream job? Or do you take what you can get? The answer lies somewhere in the middle, especially when landing your first role after Galvanize. Here are some tips on applying a growth mindset when selecting opportunities to pursue. 

1) Understand how your next role fits within the context of your broader career. 
Get clear about what's important to you. Think about how you foresee your career evolving over time, and ensure your role helps get you closer to your goal. For example, if one wants to be a marketer, it doesn't make sense for them to take a role doing tech support. Rather, a role as a graphic designer or SEO expert makes more sense for someone going into marketing. For your first role after Galvanize, consider how it fits within your broader plans. 

2) Define (bare minimum) dealbreakers. 
We all have dealbreakers - the things that let us know a role isn't the right fit for us. They may be things like extremely long hours, insufficient pay, wrong location/ commute, or a myriad of other variables to consider. When landing your first role, it's advisable to keep your options open, and to not limit yourself by too many constraints. Stop to consider things that are absolutely non-negotiable, and be open to the rest. The fewer restrictions, the more options you have. 

3) Be open to opportunities outside the ideal.
While you may have your perfect job criteria outlined, there may be other opportunities and factors you may not have considered. Be open to the possibilities. 

4) Keep it real.
Determine what is realistic give your experience, education, location, etc. For example, as a junior engineer with no previous experience, it doesn't make sense for you to apply for a Services Architecture role. Know your market, and know how your unique experiences are valued in your market.
