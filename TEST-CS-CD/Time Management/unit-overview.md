# Time Management

## Unit Objective 

By the end of this unit, you will be able to maximize your effective time use each day while minimizing 'wasted' time (sleep and eating are not a waste of time!). 

## Unit Overview
 
Time is a finite resource, and we all have the same amount of it given to us on a daily basis. By understanding what to do with the 24 hours a day we are given each day, we unlock the ability to make our schedule work for us so that we can get into the optimal state of flow on a regular basis. 

## Before Moving Further, You Should Understand This

Throughout this unit, you will encounter several tips and techniques that individually and collectively will help you manage your time. However you combine these tips and tricks is ultimately up to you. 

There are no hard and fast rules for time management, nor is there a one-size-fits-all solution to managing one's time. In reality, time management skills are "self management" skills, and successful time management will come only with practice and regular self-assessment.
