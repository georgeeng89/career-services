* title: Assignment: Goal Setting

##### !question

In the last assignment, you created a list of all of the tasks you need to accomplish each week along with their timeboxed limit. Choose three goals- one short term goal, one medium term goal, and one long term goal that you wish to dedicate a set time toward each week.
<br><br>
Create at least one timeboxed task that relates to each goal, and add the task to your list in the same format as your previously listed tasks. If you have more than one task per goal, make sure that your total amount of time spent on the related tasks is equal to or less than the total amount of time you are dedicating to the goal each week. <br><br>
_Tip: Depending on your goals, you may already have tasks that will work toward these goals in your list. Feel free to label these tasks as goal related ones if that is the case._<br><br>
Your submission can be in text or as a link to an online shared document (such as Google Docs).

##### !question

Using the FARE system, categorize your tasks into each bucket and rank the task in each bucket from top to bottom (or numbered 1- X) in order of top to bottom priority. You will be using this list for the next exercise, so keep this in a safe place. <br><br>
_Tip: Organizing software such as BaseCamp, Asana, or Trello may make this process easier. See the Unit Overview for links to these resources._
