# Goals and Prioritization

## Objectives: 
By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
* Articulate the types of goals one might set in conjunction with time management
* Name the four elements of the FARE time bucket structure 
* Prioritize weekly tasks according to the FARE structure
<br><br>

## Rationale: 
Prioritizing tasks is an important part of deciding what gets your focus day in and day out. Having structure to this process allows you to make sure that the important things get taken care of and that you are accomplishing the things you need and want. 
<br><br>
##Goal Setting and Time Management
<br><br>In the Feedback unit, we talked about the importance of setting goals as it relates to feedback. Goal setting is also an important aspect of time management, as it allows us the opportunity to set the intent that we will dedicate a set amount of time each week toward something that improves our performance, makes us a better person, or contributes to our overall wellbeing. 
<br><br>
Whereas goals related to feedback may be more broad in nature (“I want to be a better communicator”), goals set from the time management perspective are likely to be more quantifiable in nature. For example, say that you want to learn the skills necessary to learn a new language in three months. This goal requires a measurable, dedicated amount of time in order to accomplish and can easily be planned.
<br><br>
General goals are a bit more difficult to measure in this regard, but if you want to set a general goal, ask yourself more specific questions to uncover what successfully meeting that goal looks like and how you can fit this into your schedule. 
<br><br>
As you start planning your week, take a moment to think of one short term, medium term, and long term goal to focus on. This will lead to greater life enrichment- and give you something to look forward to outside of work or school. 
<br><br>
## Prioritizing Tasks- The FARE System<br><br>
By now, you have a list of every single task that you need to have completed in a given week, and how long each one of those tasks will take you to complete. 
<br><br>
Now, here comes the million dollar question: 
<br><br>
_Which one of those tasks is the most important?_
<br><br>
How do you determine what you should do first? 
<br><br>
Enter the concept of FARE. FARE is a sorting system that allows you to rank all of your tasks in order of priority so that you know what you should prioritize week over week. By following this system, you will gain a better understanding of what is the most important to you day to day. It also will ensure that you are the best version of yourself and that you stay well rested, fed, and healthy and that you aren’t allowing your work tasks to creep over important things like sleep and hygiene. 
<br><br>
FARE is an acronym that stands for four different “buckets” into which you can put all of your weekly tasks, in order of priority: **Foundational**, **ASAP**, **Relief**, and **Enjoyment**. 
<br><br>
**Foundational**<br>
The items that matter the most to your general health go into the Foundational bucket. When looking at your task list, you should be able to pick out the items that meet any of the following criteria:
<br><br>

* You will die if you don’t do this thing 
* You will go insane if you don’t do this thing 
* You will not be the best version of yourself if you don’t do this thing
<br><br>

Foundational items are basic survival items that keep you running at peak efficiency and are the things that should get top priority when you are scheduling your life. Yes, this means that sleep takes priority over networking. It also means that eating is more important than cramming in one more study session.
<br><br>

Here are some of the things you might find in your Foundational bucket:

* Gym
* Meal Prep
* Sleeping 
* Meditation 
<br><br>

**ASAP**<br>
ASAP items take up the next most important level of priority. As you may have guessed, these are things that need to happen soon -within the next week- in order for your life to stay on track. Urgent tasks that take up most of your daily focus, like work, meetings, and things that you need to manage your life will go in here. Here’s a sample list of some tasks that go in the ASAP bucket: 
<br><br>


* Paying Bills 
* Meetings 
* Job Interviews 
* Homework
* Business correspondence 
<br><br>
 
**Relief**<br>
Occupying the third spot on this list is the Relief bucket, which doesn’t usually hold a lot of tasks, and can sometimes be tricky to quantify. Relief items are tasks that either a) require an initial investment of time but pay off by making your overall process a lot more efficient or b) are things that you really dread doing, have an extended deadline, and will make you feel a lot better once you finally get them done. You may not have many Relief items in your task list every week, but when you do, they might look like this: 

* Doing your taxes 
* Scheduling your week 
* Re-organizing your filing systems 
* Writing boilerplate for commonly sent correspondence 
<br><br>

**Enjoyment**<br>
The last bucket, Enjoyment, contains tasks that provide you long term enjoyment or professional success if you invest time in them now. This bucket also contains things that may help you further your goals that you have set for each week. This list may contain things such as: 
<br><br>
* Networking events 
* Coding a side project 
* Reading 
* Spending time with friends 

<br><br>
_Note_: This list is primarily for items that will provide productive, long term enjoyment. While watching television may be enjoyable, it doesn’t mean that it belongs in the Enjoyment category- that type of activity should go into your remaining free time after everything has been scheduled. 
<br><br>
After your sort your tasks into their respective buckets, you can further break down the priority of items by ranking each list in order of what is most important to you, with the most important tasks at the top, and the least important tasks at the bottom of each list. By doing this, you now have an easy to follow list of things you want to accomplish in order of importance- and you know how long each of those items will take.
