# Day to Day Prioritization

## Objectives: 
At the end of this lesson, you will be able to: 
* Identify the quadrants of the Urgent/Important Matrix 
* Use critical thinking to sort and prioritize your day to day tasks 
* Identify helpful time tracking tools to further your daily reflection 

## Rationale: 
Planning your week gives you a high level overview of how you want to allocate your time, but your daily schedule is likely to have conflicting priorities. Making sense of these priorities allows you to decide what is ultimately important to you- and allows you to regain control over the time management decisions that you make for yourself. 

### Prioritizing Tasks Using the Urgent Important Matrix

In his book _The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People_ , Dr. Stephen Covey took a principle pioneered by Dwight Eisenhower and made it a mainstream time management tool called the Urgent Important Matrix. This matrix separates tasks into four quadrants of priority based upon whether the task at hand is **Urgent** or **Not Urgent** and **Important** or **Not Important**:
<br><br>

**Quadrant 1: Urgent/Important**<br>
 These are tasks that require your immediate attention and have high impact - quick wins! Things like job interviews, last minute opportunities for a warm introduction, or an emergency bug fix will fall into this category. 
<br><br>
Completing these tasks first can lead to a sense of euphoria from the dopamine rush that you may get from completing them on a short timeline. (They also can hit your adrenaline if they are an emergency!) These items should be at the top of your to-do list. 
<br><br>
Imagine this scenario: 
You've been working on a project for class, and you've been making decent headway in advance of your presentation tomorrow. With your latest push to github, something is causing _all_ of your functionality to stop working. You also have a writeup of the README that is due tomorrow that you have planned on finishing this evening. Tasks like these are both _urgent_ on account of the immediate deadline and _important_ because they have a significant impact on your overall project health. 
<br><br>
**Quadrant 2: Important/Not Urgent**<br>
 While these tasks may not need to be completed immediately, they often have high impact and require planning, meaningful thought, and strategy. Things like long term relationship building via networking, working on business proposals, or working on a takehome assignment that is due in a few days will fall into this category. 
<br><br>
It’s important to note that a lot of people shy away from this quadrant, because they often prefer the short term gain of “doing” instead of planning. However, people who spend the most time in this quadrant of their schedule find that they are calmer and more in control of their life than those who do not. By devoting a bit of time to planning and strategizing for long term projects and goals day over day, fewer crises arise later on- and you will be likely be able to deal with issues well before they become a problem. 

**Quadrant 3: Urgent/Not Important**
<br>
These tasks tend to be interruptions that we react to, and take our focus away from important tasks on our to-do list, acting as “filler” work: 
<br><br>
* Responding to emails (or LinkedIn messages) 
* Meetings
* Phone calls 
<br>

When you spend time on tasks in this schedule, keep in mind that your time is being controlled by other people’s asks for time instead of your own. While small doses of this are common, people who spend a significant portion of their schedule in this quadrant may feel like they’re stuck, stressed and not getting anywhere.
<br><br>
By reviewing your task list and prioritizing things that are important first, you minimize the time spent in this quadrant- and it also means you may need to say “no” if they just don’t fit into your schedule. 
<br><br>
**Quadrant 4: Not Urgent/Not Important** 
<br>
These are the tasks that are time wasters- Internet surfing, checking Facebook, YouTube hopping, excessive personal calls and the like. Occasional, strategic use of this quadrant can actually be a very good thing for refreshing and resetting your brain (e.g. when you take a break after completing a pomodoro), but excessive time spent in this quadrant usually happens unintentionally. 
<br><br>
Spending a lot of time in this area means that you are robbing yourself of time that can be used in better ways- and too much of doing this can lead to missed deadlines, stress around completing tasks on time, and a lot of negative self-talk around your own ability to get things done.

As you plan out your to-do list, think about the importance and urgency of each task on a _daily_ basis, and place them in the proper quadrant. This will allow you to get a better handle on what matters to you as you work through your day. 

### Reflection

Daily reflection is also an important part of time management, much as it is with learning. By spending about 15 minutes at the end of each day to reflect, you can better assess how you are making progress toward your goals, where you have actually spent your time, identify new priorities as they come up, and better plan for the following day. 
<br><br>
During your reflection, you should take stock of the following: 
<br><br>
* What tasks did I accomplish? 
* How long did each task take compared to my estimated time?
* How did I actually spend my time? 
* What is important to accomplish tomorrow? 
* How am I feeling about my productivity today?

**Time tracking tools**<br>
<br>
Determining how you actually spent your time can seem like a simple task, but if you’re not writing the actual time spent down every time you check an item off your to-do list, you may lose track of time. (Not to mention, if you’re unintentionally wasting time on social media, you’re not likely to be tracking that, either!) Thankfully, there are several tools available to help you track your time automatically, some with integration across different software applications. This is a small starter list:<br><br>
