# Introduction to Time Management 

## Objectives:
By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
* Define and utilize timeboxing 
* Explain the process of the pomodoro technique 
* Articulate the benefits of both time management strategies 
<br><br>

## Rationale: 
In order to get a grasp on your time and workload, it’s important to understand the basic tools and concepts behind time management. These tools will help you build your schedule and get a better sense of your own productivity. 
<br><br>

## Why Does Time Need Managing? 
Time is a social construct that is the great equalizer. Unlike money, food, or property, we as humans are given an equal amount of time every single day. It’s a finite resource (we will all die eventually), but within the space of a single day, every human on this planet is given 24 hours. (That’s 1440 minutes, or 86,400 seconds if you want to get pedantic.) 
<br><br>

So why is it that we constantly say “I have no time”? Why is it that some people seem to be ridiculously productive, whereas people are perpetually running behind? 
<br><br>

The key differences between your local slacker and someone like, say, Tim Ferriss, is time management. It’s the way in which humans structure those hours each and every day to stay productive, rested, educated, healthy, and composed. 
 
<br><br>

To simplify this explanation: time management is choosing how you want to spend your hours each and every day and staying committed to that choice.<br><br>

The best piece of life advice I was ever given came to me from my boss at a previous company, after I got exasperated during a particularly stressful project and  I lamented that I just didn’t have time for anything outside of work like hobbies or even feeding myself. 
<br><br>

His words rang like a much needed bell of truth in my ears. 
<br><br>
_**“The things in your life will only take up the time that you allot them.”**_
<br><br>

This is why time management is important. If you don’t have an idea of what you’re doing, when you are doing it, and how much time you want to give to it, you have no road map, and no plan, and no agency over your life.

<br><br>


## Timeboxing 
Timeboxing is the starting building block of time management. (Or should I say that it is a building box?) Timeboxing is simply the process of looking at the scope of a piece of work or a task, and assigning a time period in which this task will be completed. This time period is known as a timebox. 
<br><br>

Once you begin working within the timebox, you adhere to the schedule that you have set out- be that five minutes, ten minutes, or an hour. When the time is up, the working period is over. Regardless of where you are in the process of completing the task, it is time to move on to the next task and the next time box. If you have not completed the task, assess what is left to be completed; this will then be put into another time box to continue at a later time. 
<br><br>

Timeboxing is a beneficial practice for a few reasons: <br><br>
**It forces prioritization.** When we are faced with a limited time in which to accomplish something, we are much more likely to focus on the important parts of the task and are much less likely to fall into a rabbit hole. For example, if I give myself an hour to complete a ten slide PowerPoint, I’m much more likely to focus on getting all of the content on the deck before I begin to think about things like the font, background images, or transitions, as the content is the most important thing.
<br><br>
This seems like a trivial thing, until you fall into a Stack Overflow time sink. (Pro tip: timebox your research time.) 
<br><br>
**It improves progress and motivation.** Have you ever spent seemingly forever on a task only to feel like there is no end in sight? At some point as you’re slogging through, you’ll start to lose motivation and focus, and the task just drags on and on. 
<br><br>
When you’re operating under a timebox, you’re constantly looking forward to the next thing and you rarely have the opportunity to stagnate. 
<br><br>
**It gives you a better sense of your own productivity.** With time and practice, you’ll start to develop an awareness of how long tasks typically take you. For example, it usually takes me about 2-3 minutes to read a blog post. While that seems like trivial knowledge, it helps me when I need to do research for a project and I have limited time to do so or I want to squeeze in research time on my commute. For people working as programmers, this works wonders as you start to work on teams. By providing an accurate estimate of how longs tasks will take you to finish, you can plan projects efficiently- and if you are a freelancer, you know how to accurately bill your time. 
<br><br>
**It prevents you from being a perfectionist.** If you tend to over-scrutinize things and edit line after line of code in order to make everything perfect, you may lose sight of the overall goal of, say, getting an app to work. In the culture of ship fast and iterate often, timeboxing will encourage you to break things, iterate, break things again, and fix. This is okay- and this will develop your problem solving skills in the process! 
<br><br>
When you first begin to timebox, it’s understandable and expected that you will under- or overestimate how long things will take you to accomplish. Try not to get frustrated with this process, but use reflection to assess where the gaps are in your awareness. Remember, the goal with timeboxing is forward momentum, not extension. Set your timeboxes first and move through them until you are completed for the day or the lesson- then re-assess and timebox the remaining components and tasks that need completion. 

## The Pomodoro Technique
Invented in the early 1990’s by entrepreneur and developer Francesco Cirillo, the pomodoro technique was named after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that he used to track his work while he was studying at university. 
<br><br>

Much like timeboxing, the pomodoro technique is pretty straightforward: when faced with a large task, break it down into smaller timeboxed subtasks (called pomodoros) and space them apart using short breaks. This trains your brain to work in focused bursts of productivity while allowing time for you to take regular breaks. 
<br><br>

To implement this technique, all you really need is a timer- this can be on your phone, an egg timer, or even a timer that you can find on the internet (This unit overview contains links to several pomodoro timers designed for programmers). I also like to use a piece of paper and a pen for keeping track of my pomodoros. 
<br><br>

Here’s how you get started with this technique: 
<br><br>

1. Choose your task to be accomplished and timebox it. (For optimal productivity, you should work for a maximum period of 25 minutes. If your task is longer than that, break it down into a set of smaller sub-tasks.) 
2. Set the timer to the timebox. 
3. Work on the task -and only that task*- until the timer rings, and then put a checkmark on your piece of paper. 
4. Take a short 3-5 minute break. (Watch a cat video on the internet!) 
5. Repeat steps 1-4, and take a 15-20 minute break after every fourth pomodoro. 
<br><br>

*If you find a thought crossing your mind that takes your attention off of your sprint of work, this is where the pencil/paper come in handy. Simply write the thought down on the paper and go immediately back to what you were doing until the timer rings. 
<br><br>

When following this technique, you can get a lot done over the course of a day, while still having enough time to take plenty of coffee/bathroom breaks and feel recharged. 
<br><br>

One thing to keep in mind about this technique is that a pomodoro is an indivisible unit of work. If you get distracted by something (for example, an emergency or a meeting), you will either need to end the pomodoro then and there (which means saving your work and returning to it later in a new pomodoro) or postpone the interruption until you are finished with your pomodoro.
<br><br>

If the distraction comes from another colleague/boss and it’s fairly urgent, you can use the following strategy to possibly keep your flow without postponing your pomodoro or offending the interrupting party:
<br><br>

* Tell the interrupting party that you’re working on something right now 
* Agree on a time that you can get back to them in a timely manner
* Confirm the follow up time 
* Touch base with the part after the pomodoro is complete and you have the cycles to work on their issue.  
<br><br>

By following this technique, you can also determine which distractions merit your immediate attention, and which can possibly be negotiated and finished at a later time. This gives you much more control over your flow and your workday.
