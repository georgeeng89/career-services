# Why Write a Cover Letter?

## Objectives:

By the end of this lesson, students will:
- Be able to explain the purpose of a cover letter, and who is likely to read them

## Rationale:

On many job ads, you will see a request for a cover letter. Others will give the option of adding a cover letter, though they may not require it. The cover letter is an important part of your job search toolkit and you should be able to write them efficiently and effectively. 

### Who actually reads cover letters?

You may be surprised to learn that many potential employers will not even read your cover letter. A [recent study](http://www.addisongroup.com/news/your-cover-letter-and-volunteer-experience-dont-matter-to-hiring-managers-s/) showed that, nationwide and industry-wide, only about 18% of hiring managers think that a cover letter is important. 

As I’m sure you can imagine, there are many industries where a cover letter is more crucial - such as in journalism or anything involving writing. In tech, the percentage of hiring managers that read your cover letter is actually much lower - by some estimates, closer to 5%. 

Several factors contribute to this, such as: 
- general lack of interest and an assumption that your cover letter will not add any value (many badly written cover letters don’t); 
- use of applicant tracking systems that don’t encourage it (Lever and Greenhouse, which are two of the most popular ATSs on the market, separate the cover letter from the resume, which makes it much more likely that someone will make a decision to interview you based on your resume alone); 
- the fact that many cover letters are sent as attachments in email (most people are too lazy to open two attachments and will only open the resume attachment).

However, even within tech, there are certain times that your cover letter is more likely to be read, and it is important to recognize when these are:

- **When you’re applying to a smaller business or startup.** Companies that have lower application traffic have more time to spend on every applicant, which includes things like reading cover letters. Additionally, these kinds of companies tend to want people who are passionate about what they are working on, since they are unlikely to be able to offer the highest salaries on the market in the near-term. 

- **When you’re applying to a non-profit or mission-focused company.** Similar to the small startups, mission-focused companies place a heavier focus on attracting candidates that are interested in the impact the company is looking to make. These hires tend to stick around longer, and be more productive. This kind of information can be difficult to portray in a resume, and is much better suited to a cover letter. 

- **When the hiring manager is more traditional or a baby boomer.** If you know your hiring manager is a fan of a traditional hiring process, you can be more confident that your cover letter will be read as part of that process. 

- **When your hiring manager needs more information after the interview.** Occasionally, your cover letter will be read not as part of the screening process, but later into the interview process. At times a hiring manager will use the content of the cover letter to help them reflect on a certain candidate and their suitability for a role.

- **When the company uses a cover letter as a filter.** Some companies will ask for cover letters as part of the job application mostly just to see if you can follow directions. In this situation, only candidates that submit cover letters will be in consideration to continue on in the process. If you are selected (usually on the basis of your resume), they will often read your cover letter.

At the end of the day, you never know which hiring managers actually care about cover letters and will be reading them, which is why it’s important that you always write a cover letter. 

However, since there’s a good chance your cover letter won’t be read, it’s important to be able to write cover letters efficiently and effectively, so you don’t spend time on them that could be better used elsewhere.

To have a better chance of getting your cover letter read, follow these tips:

Send it as the body of an email to the hiring manager or recruiter
- Keep it SHORT and to the point
- TAILOR it to the job
- SHOW your personality
- KNOW the person you are sending it to

### What are advantages of writing a cover letter?

Though they aren’t always going to be read, cover letters can actually be a very valuable tool in your job search. Here are some reasons that having a cover letter is so important:

- **They allow you to show passion for a SPECIFIC company and a SPECIFIC role.** It has become harder and harder to get a job, and the use of applicant tracking systems to filter out applications has encouraged job seekers to spam out their resumes to every job they can find. It’s not uncommon for a recruiter to call a candidate about a job, only to realize that the candidate has no idea what the company is. Employers now especially appreciate knowing that people are interested in their specific companies.
- **They allow you to show your personality.** At the end of the day, people always hire the people they like - for better or for worse. A cover letter is a great opportunity to show your personality and catch the eye of a hiring manager.
- **They allow you to explain how your experience relates to the job.** While your resume will give the highlights of your experience, the cover letter is your opportunity to show how what you have done has specifically prepared you for the role at hand. 
- **They allow you to fill in the gaps.** Some people have unemployment or education gaps on their resumes - life happens! The cover letter is a great place to address any concerns that potential employers may have about this.
- **They allow you to show how you can solve problems.** In an ideal situation, you’ve done research on a company (or completed an informational interview!). You know their pain points, and you know why they are looking to fill a certain role. Your cover letter gives you the opportunity to tell your potential employer how you are going to solve the problems that they are currently having and help grow their business.
