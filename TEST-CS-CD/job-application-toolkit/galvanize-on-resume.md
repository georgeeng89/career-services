### How to list Galvanize on your Resume?

Depending on your previous experience and education, you may find that it is most beneficial to put Galvanize under “Experience” -- or under “Education”.

A good rule of thumb is:
- If your prior work experience is relevant to roles that you will be applying to (somehow analytical, technical, or leading projects, etc.), put Galvanize under “Education”.
- If your prior work experience is totally not relevant, put Galvanize under “Experience”.

If you put Galvanize under “Experience”, you should call yourself “Data Science Student” or “Web Development Student”, or just write the name of your program: “Data Science Immersive” or “Web Development Immersive.”

**Do not call yourself a “Fellow”. This program is NOT a fellowship and some employers find this misleading.**

Since some people are unfamiliar with what Galvanize is, you should also include a description of the program. This description should include the length of the program and/or hours involved, what you learned (technologies, as well as softer skill sets), and that it has a project-based curriculum. This are some examples of what this may look like:
