## Objectives: By the end of this lesson, students will:
- Be able to explain the role of the resume in a job search

### Resume-Writing Mindset

There are two routes to getting an interview - a **cold application** (applying through a company web site or a job board) and a **warm application** (applying through a known contact). 

Studies have shown that cold applications don’t get the same kind of results for a few important reasons. About **50% of applications are never even seen** because they are filtered out by applicant tracking systems as being not a good match for the job at hand. 

After this process, if your resume has made the cut, a recruiter will look at it for between 3 and 30 seconds - one study suggests an average time of **6 seconds.**

Take a moment now to pull up your resume. Time yourself for 6 seconds and glance over it. What stands out to you? What do you notice about your ability to read details?

In contrast, if you have a warm introduction, the recruiter will read your resume for significantly longer - **spending 1 to 2 minutes on it.** If you spend a full minute reading your resume, how much detail do you notice? What stands out to you? Would you want to call yourself in for an interview based on the content?

Once you make it through this initial screening, employers will use your resume throughout the hiring process. They will be looking at it to see how you can add value to their teams, to learn more about you and start conversations, and will also structure interview questions around your resume. 

Many people struggle to write resumes because they are so attached to their experiences and the lessons that they have learned in work. However, it’s important to view your resume through the eyes of your employer. Keep the following points in mind as you go through this lesson, and re-write your resume:


* **Create your resume to reflect the job you WANT, not the jobs you’ve previously had.** Just like with all the re-branding work you’re doing at Galvanize, your resume should scream “Web Developer” or “Data Scientist”. 

* **“What can you do for me?”** This is the #1 question a potential employer is thinking when he or she looks at your resume. For that reason, it’s important that your resume only include information that is relevant and transferable to the employers who are reviewing your resume and the specific types of jobs that you’re applying to; your resume should NOT be a history of everything that you’ve done. 

* **Work history on your resume should highlight the best things you’ve done in the past - this isn’t the time for a full job description.** Nobody cares about everything you’ve done. What they do care about is knowing how you’ve made a big impact in whatever your previous career was.

* **Be specific and don’t use cliches.** Many people fill up previous resume space by using trite phrases that are so overused, they mean nothing. Avoid saying things about yourself like, “I’m a hard worker” or “I’m a team player.” Instead, fill your resume with practical skills that can be backed up with examples.

### How does a technical resume differ from a traditional resume?

For many Galvanize students, a technical resume is a new version of your skills and experience, and differs from your previous resumes. Two sections that makes technical resumes different from traditional resumes (i.e., the resume I might use as a career coach, or someone might use to land a role in finance or retail sales): **skills and projects.** You want to showcase your technical languages and skills - and then how you have used those skills in the past to provide proof of aptitude. We’ll dive into how to create these sections in a bit.

Your resume will differ from your classmates’ in content, but the sections and formatting should be similar. 

The first three sections—your header, summary, and skills—are quick facts; they help the employer decide if they should bother reading the rest of your resume. 

The remaining sections—your education, projects, and experience—offer proof that what you listed in your summary and skills sections is true; they provide examples of how you have used the skills that you list in your skills section. For example, if your skills sections says that you know JavaScript, employers want to see an example of how you have used or learned JavaScript in your education, projects, or experience section. 

Regarding order, your header should always be at the top of your resume, followed by your summary, and then your skills. With the remaining sections, organize them according to what will be most impressive to employers. Keep your experience and projects sections lumped together for organizational flow.

We will dive into each of these sections in more detail in the next lesson.
